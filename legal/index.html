  <p>I believe in the principle of sharing information. Except where noted otherwise below, content on this site is licensed under a <a rel="license"  href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License</a> which means you can share or remix my work if you attribute the work by mentioning my full name, <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Simon Schoeters</span></span>, and a link to this website.</p>

  <h2>Tracking</h2>

  <p>This website does not track its visitors. I do not need to know who visits what page and cross-reference it with all blogs on the interwebs to learn how to improve its “user experience”. I guess that automatically makes this website <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliant as well.</p>

  <p>Some images on this website are loaded directly from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/schoeters/" rel="me" title="My photo’s @ flicr, a photo hosting site">flickr</a>. No information is shared with them, but they can see your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address when the images are loaded from their servers.</p>

  <h2>Content</h2>

  <p>This policy page is based on the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies/">Creative Commons</a> policy page. The icons are from the <a href="https://feathericons.com/" title="Simply beautiful open source icons">Feather</a> collection. The font is <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont" title="Greater legibility and readability font for low vision readers">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a> by the Braille Institute.</p>

  <p>Other parts of the site may also include third party content that is licensed on different terms. Where that use is not a fair use, the different license terms of that content are either shown or the content is acknowledged to be “used with permission”.</p>
