  <p>I believe in the principle of sharing information. Except where noted otherwise below, content on this site is licensed under a <a rel="license"  href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License</a> which means you can share or remix my work as long as you attribute the work by mentioning my full name, <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Simon Schoeters</span></span>, and a link to this website.</p>

  <h2>Tracking</h2>

  <p>This website does not track its visitors. I do not need to know who visits what page and crossreference it with all blogs on the interwebs to learn how to improve its &ldquo;user experience&rdquo;. I guess that automatically makes this website <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliant as well.</p>

  <p>The photos on the <a href="/photos" title="Some of my photos" rel="me">photos</a> page, the Lego set images on the <a href="/lego" tile="Ella & Milo&apos; Lego collection" rel="me">Lego</a> page, and some photos used in my <a href="/blog/" title="My blog posts" rel="me">blog</a> posts are loaded directly from Flickr and Rebrickable. No information is shared with those websites but they can see your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address when the images are loaded from their servers.</p>

  <h2>Content</h2>

  <p>This policy page is based on the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies/">Creative Commons</a> policy page. The icons are from the <a href="https://feathericons.com/" title="Simply beautiful open source icons">Feather</a> collection.</p>

  <p>Other parts of the site may also include third party content that is licensed on different terms. Where that use is not a fair use, the different license terms of that content are either indicated or the content is acknowledged to be &ldquo;Used with permission&rdquo;.</p>
