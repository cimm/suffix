<div class="narrow-col">
  <p><a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, a search engine for searching blogs, allows any blog owner to &lsquo;ping&rsquo; his/her blog. In this way Technorati can index your blog based on the tags you assigned to your post.</p>

  <p>You can do this manually by requesting a ping with the &lsquo;Technorati ping form&rsquo; but let's have a look how we can automate this, shall we? Turns out it's really easy to do so even though it's hard to find some documentation about this on Google.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>First we'll need Ruby on Rails built in XMLRPC protocol and create a new client that listens to the Technorati web service.</li>
    <li>Next we call the weblogUpdates.ping service method and pass the name and URL of our blog. We'll keep returned result in the result parameter.</li>
    <li>Now we only need to check if the request succeeded by looking at the result parameter and we are done.</li>
  </ol>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  require 'xmlrpc/client'
  server = XMLRPC::Client.new('rpc.technorati.com', '/rpc/ping')
  result = server.call('weblogUpdates.ping', 'YOUR BLOG NAME', 'YOUR BLOG URL')
  if result['flerror']
     flash[:error] = result['message']
  end
  {% endhighlight %}
