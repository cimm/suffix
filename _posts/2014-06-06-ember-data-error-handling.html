<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>I am building a small <a href="https://emberjs.com/" title="A client side JavaScript framework">Ember</a> app for a friend, it's my first real Ember app and there is still a lot to learn. Showing validation errors when saving an <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data" title="A data persistence library for Ember">Ember Data</a> model, for example, something that took me far longer as it should have.</p>

  <p>In Ember, you can automagically access validation errors returned by the backend in your templates. <a href="https://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.Errors.html" title="DS.Errors class documentation"><abbr title="Data Store">DS</abbr>.Errors</a> handles everything for you, but, documentation is sparse and every piece has to be just right for it to work.</p>

  <h2>Server response</h2>

  <p>Ember Data expects the server to respond in a certain way. The <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> response containing the error messages should include a root element with child nodes for each error. The error elements contain arrays with the error messages:</p>

  {% highlight json %}
  {
    "errors": {
      "email": ["can't be blank"]
    }
  }
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Note that Ruby on Rails does not include the <code>errors</code> root element by default so make sure to add it:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  render json: { errors: post.errors }, status: 422
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Set your response <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> status code as well. I was responding with a 400 &ldquo;Bad Request&rdquo; but Ember Data only processes the error messages when it sees a 422 &ldquo;Unprocessable Entity&rdquo;, which is the correct status code by the way.</p>

  <h2>ActiveModelAdapter</h2>

  <p>I was using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141004181510/https://emberjs.com/guides/models/the-rest-adapter/" title="RESTAdapter documentation">RESTAdapter</a> which doesn't include the error mapping magic out of the box. Use the <a href="https://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.ActiveModelAdapter.html" title="ActiveModelAdapter documentation">ActiveModelAdapter</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers" title="ActiveModel::Serializer implementation and Rails hooks">ActiveModel::Serializers</a> Ruby gem to make it work seamlessly or add <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/bce78d5d5b28fd468b7b4f8346cf51f0326cf54f/packages/ember-data/lib/adapters/rest_adapter.js#L524-L534">this snippet</a> to your adapter definition if you need the RESTAdapter for some reason.</p>

  <h2>Saving the model</h2>

  Make sure to handle errors when saving your model:

  {% highlight js %}
  post.save().then(function() {
    console.log("Post saved.");
  }, function(response) {
    console.error("Post not saved!");
  });
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>A simple <code>post.save()</code> without promises will throw an error and stop the script execution.</p>

  <p>
    <code>Uncaught Error: Assertion Failed: Error: The backend rejected the commit because it was invalid: {...}</code>
  </p>

  <h2>Template</h2>

  <p>Finally your DS.Error object should contain all the error messages as attributes so you can access them individually.</p>

  {% highlight ember %}
  {% raw %}
  {{#each error in errors.email}}
    {{error.message}}
  {{/each}}
  {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %}
