<p>The <a href="https://ipfs.io" title="A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open">InterPlanetary File System</a>, <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> for short. A cool name, but what does it do?</p>

<h2>Distributed</h2>

<p><abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> is part of the distributed web movement, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Web 3.0&rdquo;. While &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; is the social web we all got used to, &ldquo;Web 3.0&rdquo; is the idea we need to move from a <em>decentralized</em> to a <em>distributed</em> network.</p>

<p>The current internet is a decentralized system: a few big nodes control most of the internet. Think of Facebook, Google, Amazon. What happens if one of these services is not available? What about <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> or Google Cloud, what if those go down? What if they don't only go down but disappear? Remember GeoCities, MySpace, TwitPic? What if your government blocks access to Twitter, Wikipedia? A decentralized web could be more resilient, more difficult to censor. <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> is one possible cog in the distributed web machine.</p>

<h2>Supersede <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr></h2>

<p><abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> aims to supersede <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>. The current internet is location-based, a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> tells you <em>where</em> a document lives, not its content. The content disappears if the URL breaks (yeah, that never happens). Information gets lost. <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr>, is different, it's content, not location-based. You don't ask it to fetch the document at this location, you ask it to fetch this document and it will figure out where to get it from. As long as someone has a copy it will find it.</p>

<h2>Gateways</h2>

<p>The easiest way to access <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> is by using one of the gateways. <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/ipfs.io" title="IPFS on IPFS">https://ipfs.io/ipns/ipfs.io</a> loads the <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> website from… <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr>. <a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/ipfs.io" title="IFPS via Cloudflare's gateway">https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/ipfs.io</a> does exactly the same but uses Cloudflare's gateway. This is all fine but it's still a decentralized system, not a distributed one. It still depends on the availability of these gateways.</p>

<p>Gateways are stopgaps, they bridge the <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> and <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> worlds. They make it easy to quickly load a document from <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> but you, the visitor, are not actively contributing to the network.</p>

<h2>Your own node</h2>

<p><abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> can be <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/" title="IPFS installation instructions">installed</a> on any computer. Your computer now becomes a node, an active participant on the distributed web. It will keep a copy of the content you load form <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> and serve it to others when they ask for it. The more popular a file, the more peers will cache the file and the fast it will load when someone needs it (since there is a good chance someone close to you already has it). Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" title="BitTorrent @ Wikipedia">BitTorrent</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll need an <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> aware browser to really take advantage of the InterPlanetary File System. Your Chrome or Firefox browsers have no idea those <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> links above are something special. It’s still plain old <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Add the <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion" title="IPFS browser extension">IPFS Companion</a> to your browser and visit ipfs.io again. The <abbr title="Uniform Recource Locator">URL</abbr> should now change to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipns/ipfs.io, otherwise known as your very own computer. Congratulations, you are now part of the distributed web!</p>

<h2>Pinning</h2>

<p>A node does not keep these copies around forever, it will remove older copies if it runs out of allocated disk space. This means our precious documents will still vanish if people stop sharing them. That’s where pinning comes in. You can choose to pin a document, telling <abbr title="InterPlanetary File System">IPFS</abbr> that this is a file you want to keep around. Your local node will keep that copy around forever (or until you unpin it) and serve it to anyone requesting it.</p>

<p>There still is an issue here, what if your node is not online? Your laptop isn’t always connected to the internet. The most decentralized solution would be to have your own server pinning the same content (as in “a machine always connected to the internet”), but there are some commercial services available as well: <a href="https://www.pinata.cloud/" title="Pinata Pinning Service">Pinata</a> or <a href="https://temporal.cloud/" title="Pinning and other IPFS services">Temporal</a>.</p>
