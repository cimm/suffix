description: A list of my currently installed, privacy-focused, Firefox extensions.
---

<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>A quick overview of my currently installed <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Get the latests Firefox browser">Firefox</a> extensions. Mostly privacy-oriented add-ons. Quick word of warning, some of these add-ons will break certain webpages, you might have to turn them off for some badly written websites.</p>
  
  <h2>uBlock Origin</h2>

  <p>“Friends don’t let friends surf without adblocker.”</p>

  <p>The interwebs are a horrible place without ad filtering. Not only do you enjoy less cluttered pages with a blocker, you also save bandwidth and battery, get faster page loading times, increased protecting against malvertising, and better privacy. Why would you not use an adblocker?</p>

  <p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Product"><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" title="uBlock origin repository @ GitHub" itemprop="name">uBlock Origin</a> by <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemprop="brand"><span itemprop="name">Raymond Hill</span></span> is, without a doubt, my № 1 extension. I added extra domains to my blocklist to help keep me focused. Clicked a Twitter link? The uBlock warning is enough to stop me from procrastinating (I can still temporarily unblock if needed). My custom blocklist includes some more privacy-violating domains, annoying chat bubbles, and more generic time sinks.</p>

  <h2>Multi-Account Containers</h2>
      
  <p>Firefox’s <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/" title="Add-on download page">Multi-Account Containers</a> is second. All Google properties are separated in their container, as is my work stuff. The coloured tabs help identify the purpose of each tab. Also useful for using multiple accounts in the same browser (instead of using different browsers): personal and work Twitter accounts for example. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers" title="Multi-Account Containers knowledgebase @ Mozilla">More info &amp; screenshots</a>.</p>

  <h2>Cookie AutoDelete</h2>
  
  <p>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/" title="Add-on download page">Cookie AutoDelete</a> is a new addition this year, and it quickly rose to 3<sup>rd</sup> place. Firefox already blocks 3<sup>rd</sup> party cookies (if configured) but Cookie AutoDelete removes all cookies a few seconds after you close a tab. Over the last 4 weeks or so it removed over 15.000 cookies! You can whitelist domains as well (or you’ll have to log in every&hellip; single&hellip; time), so far I only felt the need to whitelist 4 domains. You can turn off the noisy notifications but keep it on in the beginning as a reminder, it will help you learn what to whitelist. Really happy I finally installed Cookie AutoDelete, it’s a game-changer!</p>
  
  <h2>KeePassXC-Browser</h2>
  
  <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/" title="Add-on download page">KeePassXC-Browser</a>, auto-fills my passwords in combination with the <a href="https://keepassxc.org/" title="Cross-platform offline password manager">KeePassXC</a> password manager. Not as well integrated as 1Password or LastPass but fully open-source, free, and no “cloud” stuff.</p>
  
  <h2>URL to QR code</h2>

  <p>Moving on to the less essential add-ons. <a href="https://github.com/smoqadam/url-to-qrcode-firefox-addon" title="URL to QR code Firefox Extension @ Github">URL to QR code</a> shows the current <abbr title="Uniform Recource Locator">URL</abbr> as a <abbr title="Quick Response">QR</abbr> code. I use it to easily open the current page on my phone. A poor mans <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209455" title="What is Handoff @ Apple">iPhone Handoff</a> solution for those without a Mac.</p>
  
  <h2>Link Cleaner+</h2>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/apiraino/link_cleaner/" title="Link Cleaner+, a fork of Link Cleaner @ Github">Link Cleaner+</a>, a fork of the no longer maintained Link Cleaner, removes <abbr title="Urchin Tracking Module">UTM</abbr> parameters from <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s. <abbr title="Urchin Tracking Module">UTM</abbr> params are the garbage at the end of a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to make it easier to track how you ended up on their site. This add-on helps copy &amp; pasting cleaner <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s and limits my digital footprint.</p>
