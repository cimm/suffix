description: Introducing web development to my two younger kids

<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>A while back I added a page with my kids’ <a href="../../lego/" title="My kids’ LEGO collection">LEGO collection</a>. It’s a little tool for family or friends to check, before they buy even more toys for them. My kids started referring to it as “their website”. Fast forward and last week they asked if they could add a page with the (comic) books they have read. The perfect opportunity to teach them a bit about web development, but how?</p>

  <p>Their LEGO page is generated from the set numbers with a Jekyll <a href="https://github.com/cimm/suffix/blob/master/_plugins/rebrickable_tag.rb" title="Jekyll plugin that fetches images and set names from a LEGO set number">plugin</a>. It works but I’ll quickly lose my 5 and 7 years old (the youngest can’t read yet and the oldest is typing at 4 <abbr title="Words Per Minute">WPM</abbr>) explaining the advantages of a static site generator. It needs to be visual, without the baggage of me being a web developer. It needs to have the magic powers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage" title="Microsoft Frontpage @ Wikipedia">MS Frontpage</a> gave me back in the nineties.</p>

  <h2>In search of the Frontpage of 2020</h2>

  <p><a href="https://glitch.com/" title="Collaborative online code environment">Glitch</a> maybe? Close, but too powerful: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">CSS</abbr>, Markdown. One to come back too when they are older but not the best starting point for younger kids. Glitch looks great to teach adults about web development though!</p>

  <p><a href="https://grapesjs.com/" title="Visual web builder framework">GrapeJS</a>? Too polished. I could see this used by the marketing department but fun enough to keep kids interested?</p>

  <p>Then I found <a href="https://hotglue.me/" title="Unique tool for web publishing & internet samizdat">HotGlue</a> which takes a completely different approach. It’s almost literally digital paper, scissors and glue. It’s quirky, it’s FUN. It’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities" title="Yahoo! GeoCities @ Wikipedia">GeoCities</a> I used to know. HotGlue is even open-source, although it doesn’t look like it’s actively being maintained.</p>

  <p>The result? <a href="https://elmi.hotglue.me/" title="My kids’ first website">Elmi’s boekenwebsite</a>!</p>

  <h2>Learning for fun</h2>

  <p>I won’t hide I would love them to learn something in the process (and maybe, just maybe, plant a little <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math">STEM</abbr> seed somewhere). Building their website sparked a good discussion about the public nature of the internet: do we really want the whole world to see this? It also taught them the basics of DuckDuckGo’ing and downloading/uploading images. They even fixed their first bug when they discovered you can’t simply have whitespaces in a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</a>.</p>
