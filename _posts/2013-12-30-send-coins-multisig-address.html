<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>The Bitcoin protocol has built-in support for multisig addresses. A multisig address needs <em>n</em> out of <em>i</em> signatures before the coins can be withdrawn. A good example is an escrow-like service that allows safer payments by holding the buyer's coins in escrow until the terms of the sale are met.</p>

  <p>Currently, none of the Bitcoin clients support these kinds of addresses via the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>, but it's fully supported via the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet" title="Download the Bitcoin Core client">Bitcoin Core</a> (previously named Bitcoin-Qt) client's <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</p>

  <p>You might want to run the Bitcoin Core client in <a href="/blog/getting-started-bitcoin-testnet">testnet mode</a> to play with fake coins.</p>

  <p>The example code assumes you have the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29" title="JSON-RPC API reference">Ruby <abbr title=" JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>-<abbr title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</abbr> wrapper</a> to make things a little easier.</p>

  <p>We create a Bitcoin<abbr title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</abbr> instance which we'll reuse in our examples.</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  rpc = BitcoinRPC.new('http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8332')
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h2>Bits &amp; pieces</h2>

  <p>We'll create an address that needs 2 signatures out of 3 to withdraw the coins, but you can choose whatever combination you desire. Say we have the following 3 addresses:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Buyer: <code>muYqjrmbDQTGgdJRaFwJiihk8qEionVVm4</code></li>
    <li>Seller: <code>mrtnMnUBDqdavGdWHuZRBNPRjfLCQMv1tC</code></li>
    <li>Escrow: <code>mj6zqxdBANVw4cA4MFu4E9dxL44dxGbQmH</code></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Create a multisig address</h2>

  <p>Let's get started by creating a new multisig address. The first parameter defines the number of signatures needed to withdraw the coins (2 in our example):</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  rpc.createmultisig(2, [
    "muYqjrmbDQTGgdJRaFwJiihk8qEionVVm4",
    "mrtnMnUBDqdavGdWHuZRBNPRjfLCQMv1tC",
    "mj6zqxdBANVw4cA4MFu4E9dxL44dxGbQmH"
  ])
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>This returns a new multisig address:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  {
    "address" => "2NEgZ6xYqJBNDuEnPQg8rVAUySvmPCqFWfM",
    "redeemScript" => "52210357f11...e33e917d9b7e52ae"
  }
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>This address will <strong>NOT</strong> be visible on the Bitcoin network as we haven't announced it to the network yet.</p>

  <h2>Send funds</h2>

  <p>We now need to fiddle with some transactions. Addresses are an abstraction in the Bitcoin protocol, the basic units are transactions. Take a few minutes to <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/12472" title="&ldquo;In getrawtransaction what is the vout integer in the vin list?&rdquo; @ Bitcoin StackExchange">learn why</a> transactions are so important if you are not up to speed yet and want the following to make sense.</p>

  <p>First, find an unspent transaction:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  rpc.listunspent
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>It lists all the unspent transactions in your Bitcoin Core client:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  [
    {
      "txid" => "2d1aa015385...286d958d6d9ee93cdc5821d1f",
      "vout" => 0,
      "address" => "mfm1Q7TFDb2bXwr34d6uFjD56FKRfTSr1v",
      "scriptPubKey" => "76a91402a86...1512694f175888ac",
      "amount" => 0.00663676,
      "confirmations" => 573
    },
    ...
  ] 
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>I took the first one on the list, but you probably want to mix and match transactions from this list to get to the bitcoin amount you need.</p>

  <p>Create a new raw transaction for the multisig address. The <code>vout</code> is the index of the input or output as a transaction can have multiple inputs and outputs:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  rpc.createrawtransaction(
    [{
      "txid" => "2d1aa015385...286d958d6d9ee93cdc5821d1f",
      "vout" => 0
    }],
    { "2NEgZ6xYqJBNDuEnPQg8rVAUySvmPCqFWfM" => 0.006 }
  )
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>This returns a long transaction hash:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  "01000000011f1d82c5cd93eed9d658d98682cc968c2fe48bee5d2a177ce6e2583815a01a2d0000000000ffffffff01c02709000000000017a914eb24ff395813fd1411c2093394396266d77722ff8700000000"
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p><strong>DONE</strong> You now have a transaction of 0.006 <abbr title="Bitcoin">BTC</abbr> linked to the multisig address. You'll need 2 of the 3 signatures to spend these coins.</p>

  <h2>Announce to the network</h2>

  <p>You can optionally announce the transaction to your local Bitcoin node (the Bitcoin Core client) and the network. Send the raw transaction from the previous step:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  rpc.sendrawtransaction("01000000011f...722ff8700000000")
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Have a look at the Bitcoin Core transactions tab. There should be a new pending transaction waiting for confirmation.</p>
