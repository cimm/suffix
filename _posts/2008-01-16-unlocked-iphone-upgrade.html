  <p>We had &lsquo;some&rsquo; trouble unlocking our French iPhone before we could use it on a foreign network due to a software bug in the iPhone 1.1.2 firmware as you could read in one of the <a href="/blog/iphone-unlock" title="Unlocking a French iPhone">previous posts</a>. The end result was a very expensive iPhone which we still needed to jailbreak, kinda stupid and a waste of money. Yesterday <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn" href="http://www.apple.com/">Steve</a></span> introduced the 1.1.3 firmware as expected so <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn" href="http://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Jelle</a></span> took the dive and tried it out. Well, I'm happy to report it works perfectly!</p>

  <p>I synced my iPhone and choose to upgrade. I didn't switch my SIM card back the the Orange one so I upgraded with my Base (a Belgian operator) SIM card. iTunes downloaded the 1.1.3 firmware and upgraded my phone. I got an error saying my SIM was locked, locked as in PIN locked, not network locked so that's fine. I entered my PIN code and docked my phone again. There it is my legally unlocked - non jailbraked - iPhone!</p>
