  <p>We had “<a href="../iphone-unlock" title="Unlocking a French iPhone">some</a>” trouble unlocking our French iPhone before we could use it on a foreign network due to a software bug in the iPhone 1.1.2 firmware. The end result was a very expensive iPhone which we still needed to jailbreak, stupid and a waste of money. Yesterday <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Steve</a> introduced the 1.1.3 firmware as expected so <a class="h-card" href="http://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Jelle</a> took the dive and tried it out. Well, I’m happy to report it works perfectly!</p>

  <p>I synced my iPhone and choose to upgrade. I didn’t switch my <abbr title="Subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card back the the Orange one so I upgraded with my Base (a Belgian operator) SIM card. iTunes downloaded the 1.1.3 firmware and upgraded my phone. I got an error saying my SIM was locked, locked as in PIN locked, not network locked so that’s fine. I entered my PIN code and docked my phone again. There it is my legally unlocked - non jailbraked - iPhone!</p>
