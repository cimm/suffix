<p>Rake has a new syntax for passing arguments. In the <strong>old</strong> version it looked something like this:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
task :hello, :first_name, :last_name, :needs => :environment do |t, args|
  puts "Hello #{first_name} #{last_name}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Running this task in a newer version of Rake shows a depreciation warning:</p>

<code>WARNING: 'task :t, arg, :needs => [deps]' is deprecated.  Please use 'task :t, [args] => [deps]' instead.</code>

<p>Luckily it's easy to switch to the <strong>newer</strong> syntax:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
task :hello, [:first_name, :last_name] => :environment do |t, args|
  puts "Hello #{first_name} #{last_name}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>A word of caution</h3>

<p>I took me some time to figure out why my rake task wouldn't accept multiple parameters. All I got was the following error:</p>

<code>Don't know how to build task 'greeter:hello[John,'</code>

<p>This, off course, has nothing to do with the new syntax as I thought but the space between my arguments on the command line.</>

{% highlight ruby %}
rake greeter:hello[John, Doe] # wrong, notice the space
rake greeter:hello[John,Doe] # right
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Standard UNIX stuff, I know, but still&hellip; sneaky.</p>
