<p>I was asked to stream an event for work the other day on a limited budget. We had different entrepreneurs pitching their ideas for a live audience and had some people joining remotely. I have no experience in audio or video streaming but given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic" title="The 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic @ Wikipedia">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, I suppose others will have the same questions. These were our requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Auditorium style presentations</li>
  <li>Around 100 people in the room, a bit less remote</li>
  <li>One way only, remote participants couldn’t ask questions</li>
  <li>Limited budget, around €200</li>
</ul>

<p>We dabbled a bit with Facebook Live a few years ago, simple streaming from a mobile phone, but the sound was atrocious and slides unreadable.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>Opted for YouTube Live since we have some experience with YouTube and didn’t need the online <abbr title="Questions and Answers">Q&amp;A</abbr>. I would have liked to build our own solution (<a href="https://www.wowza.com/" title="Self hosted video streaming platform I used in the past" class="h-product">Wowza</a> maybe) but played safe here. Maybe we’ll add Facebook Live next time, Twitch is not a good fit for our audience.</p>

<p>On the software side, I went for <a href="https://obsproject.com" title="Open Broadcaster Software" class="h-product">OBS Studio</a>. Its “scenes” feature takes the professionalism up a notch: a coming soon scene, slides with presenter overlays, etc.</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>

<p>The presentations took place in a noisy auditorium of a co-working space. Some speakers are not used to present so any additional tech, like a microphone, was a potential for failure.</p>

<p><span class="h-card">Marco Arment</span>’s <a href="https://marco.org/podcasting-microphones">Podcasting Microphones Mega-Review</a> pointed me to the <span class="h-product">Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB microphone</span> (around €100). It’s a cheap and highly praised mic that’s less sensitive to background noise, ideal for our noisy auditorium.</p>

<h2>Video</h2>

<p>My old <abbr title="Digital Single-lens Reflex Camera">DSLR</abbr> camera doesn’t support live clean video output. A webcam with a tripod mount, like the <span class="h-product">Logitech C922 <abbr title="High Definition">HD</abbr> Pro</span> (around €100), could be an acceptable budget solution. My colleague picked up an <span class="h-product">iPhone 11 Pro</span> the other day. That camera is probably way better quality so how do we capture its output?</p>

<p><abbr title="Open Broadcaster Software">OBS</abbr> Studio on macOS can see the iPhone as a video capture device when connected via <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr>. The input can be cropped in OBS to hide the camera <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>. One problem though: the camera will show a yellow square while focussing and we don’t want that in our stream. I found the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/be/app/shoot-clean-camera-feed-for-mirroring/id964565026">Shoot</a> iOS app which simply shows the camera without UI.</p>

<p>Adding a tripod as well, with phone mount, to have some control over the frame (and prevent nose shots and fumbling while streaming).</p>
