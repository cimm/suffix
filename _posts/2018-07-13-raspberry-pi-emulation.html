<p>I am building a Raspberry Pi specific <a href="https://snapcraft.io/" title="Containerised software packages that install on all major Linux systems">snap</a> package and learned you don't simply build software on an x86 Intel machine and run it on a Raspberry Pi. The Pi has an <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/differences-between-arm-and-intel/" title="The Differences Between ARM and Intel @ Make Tech Easier">ARM processor</a> and the software needs to be purposely built for this. Fine, but I don't always have a free Raspberry Pi at hand.</p>

<p>Why not virtualize the Raspberry in a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> on my laptop? No need for a physical Raspberry, no extra hardware to carry around, and I can boot up as many Pi's as I desire (or my laptop can handle).</p>

<p>I used the free and open-source <a href="https://www.qemu.org/" title="Official QEMU homepage" class="h-product u-url">QEMU</a> hypervisor to virtualise the Raspberry hardware. Let’s download and install QEMU:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt install qemu
{% endhighlight %}

<p>QEMU does not (yet) know the Raspberry kernel. I downloaded the most recent kernel from <span itemprop="h-card">Dhruv Vyas</span>’ <a href="https://github.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel" title="QEMU kernel for emulating Rpi on QEMU @ Github">QEMU RPi Kernel</a> repository and the <code>versatile-pb.dtb</code> device tree blob from the same repo (not the slightest idea what this does but it won’t run without it).</p>

<p>Only the Linux image itself left. I don’t need a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> on the Pi, it’s a build machine, so I took the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/" title="Raspberry Pi OS image downloads">Raspbian Stretch Lite</a> version. Unzipping the image gives a <code>.img</code> file.</p>

<p>With QEMU installed, the patched kernel and dtb file in place, and the Raspbian image it’s time to get the VM spun up:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo qemu-system-arm \
  -kernel kernel-qemu-4.9.59-stretch \
  -cpu arm1176 -m 256 \
  -M versatilepb \
  -dtb versatile-pb.dtb \
  -no-reboot \
  -append "root=/dev/sda2 panic=1 rootfstype=ext4 rw" \
  -net nic -net user \
  -hda 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch-lite.img
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The user-mode network used in the previous command does not support the <code>ping</code> command out-of-the-box, only TCP and UDP are. I've found better network configurations online, but they look too complex for my little test setup.</p>

<p class="h-card">This post is heavily based on <span class="p-name">Alistair Chapman</span>’s <a href="https://blog.agchapman.com/using-qemu-to-emulate-a-raspberry-pi/" title="Using QEMU to emulate a Raspberry Pi" class="u-url">blog post</a> with slight modifications to make it work for me.</p>
