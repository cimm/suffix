description: Ideas to replace paper business cards with something more automated.
---

<p>Last week a friend ordered a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=poken&iax=images&ia=images" title="Images of Pokens">Poken</a> for me as a present. This triggered a discussion over business cards and why we still use plain old paper cards in this digital age.</p>

<p>The problem is an old one: how do you keep in touch with people you recently met? You need some way to exchange personal information in an easy, unobtrusive way. Business cards are a great answer to that problem: they’re fast to exchange, cheap enough to hand out, universally accepted and portable. That’s great but isn’t it a waste of resources to print something digital on a piece of paper and have someone on the other side input the data in a system… again? Not to mention the errors this process generates: how do I interpret a Japanese address, is it his first or last name, I would like a photo as well, have I met this person before?</p>

<h2>Pokens and E</h2>

<p>Filip argued that Pokens could be the answer. Pokens are small plastic <abbr title="Radio-frequency identification">RFID</abbr> readers. High five your Poken against another one to exchange your details and the next time you log on to your social network sites your profiles will be linked. E uses the same idea but focuses on the software side: you can create multiple profiles and exchange details via an internet-enabled mobile phone. They have an RFID device - called “Connector” - in the pipeline.</p>

<p>While these services look promising, I don’t think it will be the answer. Sure, these things are focused on social networking profiles and may be fine for their target audience but that won’t cut it. Why not? </p>

<ol>
  <li>The other person needs the same service. Do you have a Poken? Or maybe you use E? It’s too much of a hassle and you will look stupid in non geeky situations, so you’ll just hand out your plain old business card.</li>
  <li>The device. I suppose a Blackberry could easily exchange a vCard over Bluetooth with all your contact details, yet no one uses it. Is it too technical? Handing out a business card needs to be as simple as possible. With E you need an ‘internet-enabled’ device, how does that hold when you are abroad?</li>
  <li>Backward compatibility. I still need my printed business cards as a failsafe measure. Why do I need 2 systems? Right, I’ll only take the cards, it’s the safer choice.</li>
  <li>Personalization. A business card is something unique, it’s a way to express yourself (or your company). A plumber’s business card looks different than the card from a graphic designer. Does it look professional, clean or playful?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Disposable RFID business cards</h2>

<p>My shot at a possible solution: the disposable RFID business card. It still needs a flashy name and ditto logo but here is the idea: combine the old business card with RFID. What if we embedded an RFID chip in a plain old business card?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Service independent. The RFID could link to a universally accepted standard (e.g., a vCard on your website). You could even think of a subscription system that automatically updates your contact’s details when they change.</li>
  <li>Device independent. If my phone has an RFID reader, I could scan the card to add it to my phone’s address book at once, if not, I keep the card and scan it later.</li>
  <li>Backward compatible. If you don’t have an RFID reader, you can use the card as you would today. This would be useful starting from day one. With a Poken you need a ‘critical mass’ first.</li>
  <li>Personalization. You can still design the card as you see fit.</li>
  <li>Digital format. Even a Japanese address would be entered correctly as I don’t need to guess which information is where, we moved this to the software now.</li>
</ol>

<p>What do we need? I’m not sure but maybe RFID tags are still too expensive to throw away? With prices around 50¢. It’s still a little too expensive if you add the price of the business card. RFID chips are designed to be thrown away (look at packaging) so I suppose prices will drop. People also need an RFID reader but that’s just a matter of time. More companies sell RFID readers: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090126063552/http://violet.net:80/_mirror-give-powers-to-your-objects.html" title="The Violet mir:ror, a RFID reader">Violet</a> and tikitag amongst them.</p>

<p>What do you think? Will we replace business cards soon and if so, what will the successor look like?</p>
