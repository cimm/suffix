<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090308030728/http://theecostrip.com:80/" title="A power strip to turn off peripheral devices when the computer is turned off" class="p-product">EcoStrip</a> is a power strip with a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> plug for a computer and its peripheral devices. Connect the USB plug with the computer and the power strip will turn on or off all other devices when the computer is turned off. A great way to conserve energy.</p>

<p>The press release in <time>2007</time> was picked up by many popular blogs like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ecostrip-saves-energy-polar-bears-305105" title="Ecostrip Saves Energy, Polar Bears">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100701193101/https://www.everythingusb.com/usb_ecostrip_13422.html" title="USB Ecostrip Saves Power">EverythingUSB</a> and <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/gadgets/ecostrip-power-bar-coming-to-north-america.html" title="Ecostrip Power Bar Coming to North America">TreeHugger</a>, amongst other. There is even a Facebook group (no longer available) with 161 fans.</p>

<p>So far so good but, to me it looks suspicious. I was looking for a European version of the EcoStrip as I wanted to buy one so I tried to contact them via the contact form on their website. I never received a response. Looking at the website in a little more detail revealed some other strange things: there is no address, no name of a responsible and the last news item dates from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071221082546/http://www.theecostrip.com/" title="Compare the current site with the 2007 version in the Wayback Machine">2007</a>. I added one to the shopping cart but there is no checkout button. Is this company legit? Did anyone buy an EcoStrip?</p>

<p>The only reference I could find is the number at the bottom of the website which leads to a <a href="https://www.google.com/patents?id=-0wOAAAAEBAJ" title="Patent 6586849 in Google Patent Search">US patent</a> on the name of <span class="h-card">Morton Tarr</span>. A Google search on his name did not return anything relevant.</p>

<p>Do you know anyone who bought an EcoStrip or do you know similar power strips I could buy in Europe?</p>
