<p>Today we launched a new website: <a href="http://www.milkcarton.be/" title="Mac OS X applications and frameworks by milkcarton" class="ext" rel="me">milkcarton.be</a>. Last year we started developing a small Cocoa application but got stuck and never got to something &lsquo;release worthy&rsquo;, the half finished program was waiting there to be forgotten. A few months ago we decided to pick up where we left of and fix the design mistakes we made last year. We started from scratch and here we are, releasing our first private beta today!</p>

<h3>Lustro</h3>

<p>What is this mysterious app? It listens to the name <strong>Lustro</strong> and is a small Address Book exporter for Mac OS X Leopard. It exports all your contacts to <abbr title="Comma-separated values">CSV</abbr>, tab-delimited or hCard files or overwrites your Google Contacts with the ones on your Mac (so that you have access to all your Address Book contacts in GMail). If this sounds like something you could use you can <a href="http://www.milkcarton.be/contact" title="Contact milkcarton" class="ext" rel="me">drop us a note</a> as we are still looking for beta testers. Lustro is free and open source so there is no excuse to chicken out on this one.</p>

<h3>milkcarton</h3>

<p>We didn't really have a decent home for Lustro so we decided to create a new website to host these little applications, frameworks or other bits of code we designed and will design. That's <a href="http://www.milkcarton.be/" title="Mac OS X applications and frameworks by milkcarton" class="ext" rel="me">milkcarton.be</a>: hop over there to and have a look around.</p>
