<p>My invoices are generated from a LaTeX template using the <a href="../../assets/invoice.zip" title="Download the package (mirrored on this domain)">invoice package</a> by <span class="h-card">Oliver Corff</span> (no longer available now). <span class="h-card"><span class="p-name">Paul Asmuth</span> <a class="u-url" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215213244/http://paulasmuth.com/blog/latex_invoice/" title="HowTo: Write invoices in LaTeX">wrote</a></span> a little example on how to use the invoice package if you would like to try it out.</p>

<p>After installing OS X Mountain Lion and the most recent distribution of <a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/" title="Download the MacTex distrubtion">MacTex</a> (<time datetime="2012-06-01">1 July 2012</time>), my invoices wouldn't generate any more. I checked the invoice package in the TeX Live Utility and sure enough, it was installed by default and updated to the latest version the TeX Live Utility could find.</p>

<p>Still, generating an invoice with <em>pdflatex</em> kept producing the following error:</p>

<code>! LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.</code>

<p>Turns out, there is a bug with an invoice dependency trying to load the <em>fp.tex</em> definitions causing the invoice package to produce this strange error:</p>

<code>l.31 \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}[1995/12/01]</code>

<h2>RequirePackage</h2>

<p>Luckily it’s easy to patch the problem. Have a look at the <em>/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/invoice/invoice.sty</em> file and look for the line that requires the <em>fp</em> package in the ‘initialize code’ block, near the beginning of the file:</p>

<code>\input{fp}</code>

<p>And simply replace it with:</p>

<code>\RequirePackage{fp}</code>

<p>Save the file and try running <em>pdflatex</em> again. Is it fixed now?
