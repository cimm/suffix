<h2>Sports</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For most of the year, my running routine was a casual 5 km weekly loop with a friend. In the last two months, I’ve shifted to a more deliberate approach, pushing my distance slowly to around 10 km. We'll see where this leads in 2026, with plans for a longer distance goal.</li>
  <li>I participated in the La Chouffe Classic, my first organized cycling "race." It was a fantastic experience and great fun, though a downpour near the end certainly made the last 15 km a slog! The real triumph, however, was beating the Col de Haussire—a truly satisfying feeling.
  <li>Despite breaking both my elbow and wrist end 2024-on a ski trip—I was fortunate to sneak in some extra ski days early in 2025. I genuinely feared my season was over before it began. We visited Les Orres, Saint-Léger-les-Mélèzes, Chaillol, Orcières Merlette, Melchsee-Frutt, Meiringen-Hasliberg, Lermoos Grubigstein, Biberwier-Marienberg, 3 Zinnen, Val Comelico-Padola, La Berra, Gstaad, Ovronnaz, Les Marecottes, Charmey & Metabief this year and we still have a trip planned later this year!
</ul>

<h2>Home</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My kids and I spent some quality time assembling a 3D printer. While I'm still debating if this is a truly necessary tool in our home, the process of assembling it together was unequivocally one of my 2025 highlights!</li>
  <li>I despise the chaos of home renovations, but our 30-year-old kitchen was in dire need of a refresh. We redid the kitchen, taking the opportunity to ditch the gas stove for induction. The new Cooker tap, which delivers instant boiling water, was a "guilty pleasure" addition, and I have to say, it has quickly become my favorite kitchen accessory.</li>
  <li>In the spring, we were treated to a visitor: a beaver! I could observe him/her/them almost every evening right from our garden. They haven't been seen for a few months now, and I can only hope they’ve simply moved on to a new habitat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Travels</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Our main trip during the Summer holidays took us to the south of England. It was my first visit back to the UK since brexit and, a first for the kids, making it long overdue. We deliberately skipped London, saving it for a future long weekend. A clear highlight of the trip was our visit to Bletchley Park—one off my bucket list.</li>
  <li>We also managed 2 long weekend trips to Amsterdam and Luxembourg. I have driven through Luxembourg countless times but never stopped to truly explore the city—a pleasant discovery! In Amsterdam, we took our bikes and confirmed once more that if I were ever to move countries, the Netherlands would be near the top of my list. Cycling in the Netherlands is just on a different level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alcohol</h2>

<p>For some strange reason, I started tracking my alcohol intake this year. Excluding my student years, I've never been a heavy drinker, and we mostly stopped stocking alcohol at home after my wife's pregnancy a decade or so ago. The tracking had a fascinating, unexpected side effect: I now actively pause before ordering alcohol and ask myself, "Will I truly enjoy this, or am I merely ordering out of habit?"</p>

<p>So far in 2025, I've logged 39 alcohol consumptions—an average of 0.11 consumptions per day. Even more remarkably, I went from September to mid-November without drinking any alcohol, and I barely noticed. It's interesting how simply tracking a metric can influence the metric itself.</p>
