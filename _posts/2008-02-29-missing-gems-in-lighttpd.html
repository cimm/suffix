<p>After upgrading Ruby to 1.8.6 and Rails to 2.0.2 I ran intro problems with my installed gems. My application couldn’t find any of the installed gems anymore! The <samp>gem list</samp> command returned the installed gems like you would expect and even the <samp>./script/console</samp> environment in my Rails application found the gems I needed but requiring a gem in one of my controllers like:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'somegem'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>returned the following error:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
MissingSourceFile (no such file to load -- somegem)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It took ages to find out what the problem was. My GEM_PATH variable - this is where RubyGems looks for the installed gems - was set. I could find the gem from everywhere, except from within the controllers in my application. However, it did work fine when I ran the WEBrick server but when using my LightTPD production server everything went fubar.</p>

<p>Turned out I forgot to tell LightTPD to use the new GEM_PATH, other than the default one. You can do this in the LightTPD configuration file. Maybe I changed the gem installation directory as I build RubyGems from source without knowing? Add the following to your LightTPD configuration file (change the paths where needed) and reload the server.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
fastcgi.server =
(
 ".fcgi" =>
 (
  "localhost" =>
  (
   "min-procs"       => 1,
   "max-procs"       => 1,
   "socket"          => "<app>/tmp/sockets/fcgi.socket",
   "bin-path"        => "<app>/public/dispatch.fcgi",
   "bin-environment" =>
   (
    "RAILS_ENV" => "production",
    "GEM_PATH"  => "/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/"
   )
  )
 )
)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That’s it, Suffix is now happily running the latest Ruby on Rails version.</p>
