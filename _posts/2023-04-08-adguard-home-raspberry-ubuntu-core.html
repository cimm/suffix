<p>We all use ad blockers in our browsers, but what about the other devices on our network, such as smartphones and televisions?</p>

<p>That is where a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" title="A popular network-wide ad blocker">Pi-hole</a> or <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html" title="My favorite network-wide ad blocker">AdGuard Home</a> comes in, as a replacement for the network’s <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr>. When an app, website, or device requests an advertisement, the DNS examines the request against a known list of advertisers and trackers and, if it matches, pretends the ad or tracker does not exist. It is not waterproof but performs admirably.</p>

<p>I don’t want to babysit a DNS on my network, so I run a Raspberry Pi with <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core" title="Self updating Linux distribution">Ubuntu Core</a> and AdGuard Home as a <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro" title="What is a snap?">snap</a>. Ubuntu Core is designed for embedded <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> devices and depends on snap packages, but it’s the automatic updates that are valuable to us. Because snaps update automatically, as the core <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> does, and AdGuard automatically updates its block lists, we have a hands-off network-wide ad and tracking blocker!</p>

<h2>Ubuntu Core</h2>

<p>First, you will need an <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card with Ubuntu Core installed. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/" title="Raspberry Pi Imager download page">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> makes this a piece of cake. Select “Other general-purpose OS” → “Ubuntu” → “Ubuntu Core” in the Raspberry Pi Imager. Specify the SD card as the storage device and write the image to it.</p>

<p>While the image is being written on the card, create an <a href="https://login.ubuntu.com/" title="Free account for Ubuntu related services">Ubuntu One</a> account with an <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> key; you will need it when the Raspberry boots.</p>

<p>Insert the written SD card into the Raspberry Pi and follow the on-screen instructions.. Although you can connect the Pi to your Wi-Fi network, an Ethernet cable will provide a faster and more reliable connection. Not a luxury, since it will take charge of all DNS requests.</p>

<h2>AdGuard Home</h2>

<p>After configuring Ubuntu Core, SSH into the Raspberry and install the AdGuard Home snap. During installation, AdGuard will take issue with the Ubuntu DNSStubListener, so deactivate it while in command line mode.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo snap install adguard-home
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d
sudo vi /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/adguardhome.conf
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If the adguardhome.conf file and directories do not already exist, create them.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
[Resolve]
DNS=127.0.0.1
DNSStubListener=no
{% endhighlight %}
<figcaption class="highlight">↑ Add this to the adguardhome.conf resolved configuration</figcaption>

<p>Restart systemd-resolved, the service that provides network name resolution.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo systemctl reload-or-restart systemd-resolved
{% endhighlight %}

<p>On your computer’s browser, navigate to “http://ip_of_your_pi:3000” and complete the AdGuard configuration steps.</p>

<h2>Router</h2>

<p>Your router will have a <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr> <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> setting. On UniFi networks, go to “Settings” → “Networks” → edit the selected network → “DHCP” → “DHCP Service Management” → “DHCP DNS Server”. Replace that address with the IP address of the Raspberry. You can usually find the IP address in your router’s settings and on the Raspberry’s screen. The Raspberry is now responsible to translate domain names in IP addresses. When the browser asks for an ad or tacker it simply responds with “does not exist”. Simple but effective.</p>

<p>Once configured, browse around as usual and watch the AdGuard dashboard come to life.</p>

<p>Adding <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" title="uBlock Origin, the best content filter">ad blocking</a> capabilities to your browser makes it even better; the more layers of protection, the better, like an <a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/85881" title="Quote from Shrek">onion</a>.</p>

<h2>mDNS (optional)</h2>

<p>You still need to use the Raspberry’s IP address to access the AdGuard dashboard. Not too bad, but we can do better: <abbr title="Multicast DNS">mDNS</abbr> (also known as zeroconf, Bonjour or Avahi). Simply add the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/avahi">avahi</a> snap to the Raspberry Pi and set the hostname to something that makes sense.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname 'adguard'
sudo snap install avahi
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can now access the AdGuard web dashboard via http://adguard.local/ from your <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr>.
