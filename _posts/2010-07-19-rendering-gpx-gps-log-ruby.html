description: Plotting a GPS log as a SVG image with Ruby.
---

<p>I would like to plot my <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> logs from my last cycling trip.</p>

<p>Sure, you can use Google Maps, the default weapon of choice these days. With their <abbr title="Application Programming Interface ">API</abbr> you can plot your track log on top of their maps and satellite images. You don’t even have to program that, Google Maps can render <abbr title="Keyhole Markup Language">KML</abbr> files out of the box and there are tons of tools out there to do the same. As a programmer, loading KML files in Google is no fun. I want to learn to plot my own stuff.</p>

<h2>Plan of attack</h2>

<p>Obviously, you’ll need some kind of source data to start with. I keep all my logs as a <abbr title="GPS eXchange Format">GPX</abbr> file but you can use whatever format you like as you’ll have to parse it never the less. You can use the cross-platform open source tool <a href="https://www.gpsbabel.org/" title="Free software for GPS data conversion and transfer">GPSBabel</a> to convert between different formats.</p>

<p>Secondly, we also need some kind of rendering library. I went with <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/" title="Cross-platform portable command-line driven graphing utility">gnuplot</a> as there is a <a href="https://github.com/rdp/ruby_gnuplot" title="The ruby gnuplot gem">Ruby binding</a> for that one, more on this later. You’ll need to install gnuplot if you don’t have it yet.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>The gnuplot program expects tabular data in a tab separated format so our first step is to convert our source document to a gnuplot readable format. For this I parse the GPX file with <a href="http://nokogiri.org/" title="An HTML, XML, SAX and Reader parser with the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors">Nokogiri</a> (an <abbr title="Extensible Markup Languag">XML</abbr> parser):</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'gnuplot'
doc = Nokogiri::XML(open("your_file.gpx"))
x = doc.xpath('//xmlns:trkpt/@lon').map{|pt| pt.to_s.to_f}
y = doc.xpath('//xmlns:trkpt/@lat').map{|pt| pt.to_s.to_f}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It loads the GPX source file (which is an XML document after all) and extracts all the coordinates with XPath. We now have two arrays, one with the latitudes an the other with the longitudes.</p>

<h2>Plotting</h2>

<p>We can now pass our 2 data sets to gnuplot. It has no notion of spatial data so it will just link the points. Therefore we’ll need to tell gnuplot to use the same scale on both the X and Y-axis or our plotted path will be distorted (gnuplot tries to auto scale it by default).</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
Gnuplot.open do |gp|
  Gnuplot::Plot.new(gp) do |plot|
    plot.arbitrary_lines << "set size square"
    plot.data << Gnuplot::DataSet.new([x, y]) do |ds|
      ds.with = "lines"
      ds.notitle
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Got it? That’s the basic stuff, you can now play around with the gnuplot options to change colors, add a grid, change the line widths, etc.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>gnuplot is a graphing library, it’s great in drawing all kinds of graphs. It’s not that great in rendering spatial data. Please, let me know if you know a better way to plot coordinates.</p>

<p>I’m not a <abbr title="Geographic Information System">GIS</abbr> expert. This approach is way too simplified and will only work for shorter distances. If you are building something serious you may want to look at map projections, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_of_precision_(GPS)" title="Specifies the additional multiplicative effect of GPS satellite geometry on GPS precision">dilution of precision</a> and the like.</p>
