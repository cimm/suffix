<p>This weekend I was discussing what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mercier" title="Cardinal Mercier on Wikipedia" class="h-card">Cardinal Mercier</a> did during his life that he has a <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/3547962" title="Find Kardinaal Mercierlaan in Leuven in OpenStreetMap">street</a> in Leuven, Belgium named after him. As with most of these discussions these questions tend to bother me for the rest of the day. At home I would do a quick search but not everyone has a computer in their living room let alone on the train to Brussels as in this case. Wouldn’t it be nice to have Google in your pocket?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322222412/http://keishi.net/ipodia/" title="iPodia, an iPhone interface for Wikipedia">iPodia</a>, an iPhone interface for Wikipedia with an optimized layout and a find function to look for text in a longer article. The auto-completion search field makes it easy to look for a keyword. iPodia is available in 10 different languages.</p>

<p>The Dutch language option in the drop-down box forwards to the Portuguese version of iPodia at the moment but I suppose this will soon be fixed (for now you can change the code in the URL if you have to).</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Dutch language bug is fixed now as Keishi pointed out. Thanks!</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080619122216/http://www.powerset.com:80/" title="Powerset website snapshot in 2008 @ WaybackMachine">Powerset</a> released an iPhone optimized Wikipedia search engine <time datetime="2008-06-19">today (June 2008)</time>. I love the design and usability! Make sure to try out the outline views or in-article search features, it feels very Mac OS X like. It doesn’t have the multiple language support like iPodia but I changed my bookmark to Powerset right away.</li>
