description: An optimized mobile Wikipedia for iPhone.

<p>This weekend I was discussing what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mercier" title="Cardinal Mercier on Wikipedia" class="h-card">Cardinal Mercier</a> achieved that he has a <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/3547962" title="Find Kardinaal Mercierlaan in Leuven in OpenStreetMap">street</a> in Leuven (Belgium) named after him. As with most of these discussions these questions tend to bother me for the rest of the day. At home I would do a quick search but not everyone has a computer in their living room, let alone on the train to Brussels as in this case. Wouldn’t it be nice to have Google in your pocket?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322222412/http://keishi.net/ipodia/" title="iPodia, an iPhone interface for Wikipedia">iPodia</a>, an iPhone optimized interface for Wikipedia. The auto-completion search field makes it easy to look for an article or keyword in a longer article. iPodia is available in 10 different languages.</p>

<p>The Dutch language option in the drop-down box forwards to the Portuguese version of iPodia for now, but this will be fixed soon (you can change the language code in the URL as a workaround).</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Dutch language bug has been fixed as Keishi pointed out. Thanks!</li>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080619122216/http://www.powerset.com:80/" title="Powerset website snapshot in 2008 @ WaybackMachine">Powerset</a> released an iPhone optimized Wikipedia search engine <time datetime="2008-06-19">today (June 2008)</time>. I love the design and usability! Make sure to try out the outline views or in-article search features, it feels very Mac OS X like. It doesn’t have multiple language support like iPodia but I changed my bookmark to Powerset right away.</li>
