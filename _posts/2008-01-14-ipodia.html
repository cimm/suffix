<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>This weekend I was discussing what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mercier" title="Cardinal Mercier on Wikipedia">Cardinal Mercier</a> did during his life that he has a <a href="http://maps.google.be/maps?q=Mercierlaan,+Leuven" title="Find Kardinaal Mercierlaan in Leuven in Google Maps">street in Leuven</a> named after him. As with most of these discussions these questions tend to bother me for the rest of the day. At home I would do a quick Google search but not everyone has a computer in their living room let alone on the train to Brussels as in this case. Wouldn't it be nice to have Google in your pocket?</p>

  <p>Enter <a href="http://keishi.net/ipodia/" title="iPodia, an iPhone interface for Wikipedia">iPodia</a>, an iPhone interface for Wikipedia with an optimized layout and a find function to look for text in a longer article. The auto-completion search field makes it easy to look for a keyword. iPodia is available in 10 different languages.</p>

  <p>The Dutch language option in the drop-down box forwards to the Portuguese version of iPodia at the moment but I suppose this will soon be fixed (for now you can change the code in the URL if you have to).</p>

  <h2>Updates</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The Dutch language bug is fixed now as <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn ext" href="http://keishi.net/">Keishi</a></span> pointed out. Thanks!</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.powerset.com/" title="Search and read Wikipedia articles with Powerset">Powerset</a> released an iPhone optimized Wikipedia search engine <abbr title="20080619">today (June 2008)</abbr>. I love the design and usability! Make sure to try out the outline views or in-article search features, it feels very Mac OS X like. It doesn't have the multiple language support like iPodia but I changed my bookmark to Powerset right away.</li>
  </ul>
