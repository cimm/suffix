description: Configuring Xcode to build for 64 instead of 32-bit architectures.
---

<p>The System Preferences application on Mac is universal since Snow Leopard: it can run in 32-bit or 64-bit but not at the same time. That’s why you must restart the application when you want to open an older Preference Pane.</p>

<p>Today I tried to upgrade the <a href="../lazypoken/" title="A poken automounter">LazyPoken</a> prefpane as it was still a 32-bit build and the next Mac OS X will probably no longer support the 32-bit System Preferences application. That turned out to be a little harder than expected.</p>

<h2>Build settings</h2>

<p>First you should change your project ARCH flags to tell the gcc compiler it should be built for 64-bit. You can do this in Project → Edit Project Settings, choose the Build tab and look for the Architectures or ARCHS parameter. Choose the 64-bit or Universal mode (if you need to support Tiger).</p>

<p>This is not enough, however. If you try to build and install your application, you’ll notice it’s still running in 32-bit, stubborn prefpane.</p>

<p>The 64-bit System Preferences application also uses garbage collection and all 64-bit prefpanes need to support this as well. You can enable this in the same build panel under the Objective-C Garbage Collection or GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_GC parameter. Choose the Supported or Required option, again, depending on what you want to support.</p>

<p>Clean and build your application again, check for warnings and try it out. Looking better now?</p>

<h2>64-bit gotchas</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sparkle: make sure to include the With Garbage Collection version of Sparkle, you just activated garbage collection remember?</li>
  <li>Older frameworks: make sure the frameworks your application depends on compile in 64-bit mode. The Developer Tools installed with Xcode include a tool to check your code for possible 64-bit incompatibilities.</li>
</ul>
