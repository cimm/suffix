  <p>Having only managed to finish a miserable five books in 2014, I hope to force myself to read a little more this year by jotting down a few remarks on each book:</p>

  <dl class="hreview">
    <dt class="summary vcard"><span class="fn">Franz Kafka</span>’s &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial" title="The Trail @ Wikipedia" class="url fn">The Trail</a>&rdquo;</dt>
    <dd>
    <span class="description vcard"><span class="fn">Since Snowden</span>’s revelations about the <abbr title="National Security Agency">NSA</abbr>’s spying, sanctioned by a secret court, the word &ldquo;Kafka-esque&rdquo; is often dropped. The Trial is the chronicle of Joseph K.’s case, his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. I liked the link with the contemporary surveillance news but it’s <span class="rating" title="2">not my preferred bedtime reading</span>.</span>

  <dl class="hreview">
    <dt class="summary vcard"><span class="fn">Walter Isaacson</span>’s &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)" title="Steve Jobs (book) @ Wikipedia" class="url fn">Steve Jobs</a>&rdquo;</dt>
    <dd>
      <span class="description">Interesting to learn the back story of so many of the products we use every day. Jobs was no saint, and Isaacson does a good job displaying both sides of the visionary that Jobs was. I didn’t think I would like this one but it paints an interesting picture of the Homebrew Computer Club era.</span>

    <dt class="summary vcard"><span class="fn">Cory Doctorow</span>’s &ldquo;<a href="https://craphound.com/?p=5398" title="Information Doesn’t Want to Be Free: the audiobook, read by Wil Wheaton" class="url fn">Information Doesn’t Want to Be Free</a>&rdquo;</dt>
    <dd>
      <span class="description">Doctorow explains how the entertainment industry manages to transform the copyright into a profit center for the middleman and he defines what it means to own a copy in the Digital Age. As always, Doctorow manages to hit a nerve and consolidates my efforts to keep fighting to own my own data.</span>

  <dl class="hreview">
    <dt class="summary vcard"><span class="fn">David Seaman</span>’s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Bitcoin-Primer-Opportunities-Possibilities-ebook/dp/B00GZD68FC" title="The Bitcoin Primer @ Amazon" class="url fn">The Bitcoin Primer</a>&rdquo;</dt>
    <dd>
      <span class="description">As the title indicates, it is a good introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies. It’s for those who have heard of Bitcoin but have never really dug into it. If you’ve purchased something with Bitcoin or have swapped a few satoshis with a friend, this book won’t go deep enough for you.</span>

  <dl class="hreview">
    <dt class="summary vcard"><span class="fn">Richard White</span>’s &ldquo;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160914154936/http://digital-era.net/open-source-encryption" title="Encryption in Everyday Life @ Digital Era" class="url fn">Encryption in Everyday Life</a>&rdquo;</dt>
    <dd>
      <span class="description">Having tried to learn a little more about Internet security and online privacy over the last two years, I had hoped that this book would have given me some more background knowledge, but it didn’t. The spelling and grammar mistakes make it hard to read and make it feel like an unfinished draft. The book talks about PGP but good luck finding the author’s public key. It’s not helpful. &ldquo;<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/" title="Tips, Tools and How-tos for Safer Online Communications">Surveillance Self-Defense</a>&rdquo; does a better job and is easier to read. White does do a good job, however, of avoiding technical details and explaining the pros and cons of each technology in layman’s terms.</span>
