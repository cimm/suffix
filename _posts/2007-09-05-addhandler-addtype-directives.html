description: What are the differences between the AddHandler and AddType Apache directives?
---

<p>Both directives seem to define how the contents of a file with a given extension should be threatened but when do you need the first one and when the second?</p>

<p>The AddType handler specifies how the client (think about a browser) must deal with a particular data stream (e.g., download a binary or show an image or <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page). The AddHandler, on the other hand, maps a handler to the file extension telling the server what to do with it. If you define a Ruby on Rails or <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> content type you will need the AddHandler, telling the server it should parse the file. If you define a JavaScript or HTML file, you will need the AddType one to tell the browser what content type to expect.</p>

<h2>Strict versus quirks mode</h2>

<p>Something slightly related is how browsers deal with the content type you set in the AddType directive. Gecko-based browsers (like Firefox) follow the standard closely so they will handle a file according to the content type from the Apache configuration. An image would show up as text if you wrongly assigned the text/plain content type. Internet Explorer is more flexible and tries to guess the mime type for misconfigured web servers showing a wrongly defined image as, well, an image.</p>
