<p>I needed a small disk image (a .dmg file) for the Lightroom <a href="../lightroom-iphoto-export/" title="Lightroom to iPhoto export">export plugin</a> I wrote earlier but for some reason the built-in “Disk Utility” program in Mac OS X Leopard does not allow you to create a disk image smaller than 10 <abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr>. Sure, you can select a custom size but the tool changes it back to a minimum of 10 MB with the following message:</p>

<blockquote>The image size was changed to 10 MB because that is the minimum image size.</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea why it says that because you <strong>can</strong> make smaller disk images, just not via the Disk Utility program. Fire up “Terminal” and see for yourself. The following command creates a disk image in HFS+ format with a size of only 600 <abbr title="kilobyte">KB</abbr>:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
hdiutil create -size 600k myImage.dmg -srcfolder myFolder/ -fs HFS+
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The size can be specified with <samp>-size &lt; ?? | ??b | ??k | ??m | ??g | ??t | ??p | ??e &gt;</samp> but the minimum disk image size with this method is still 512 KB. I don’t understand this minimum size as the created disk image is only as large as the data it contains. When I use this method to create a disk image with an empty folder the resulting image is only 10 KB, not 600 KB as specified in with the “-size” option.</p>
