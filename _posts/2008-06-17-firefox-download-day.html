  <p>I'm a Mac user and ever since Leopard is out I switched back to Safari. Admitted, it wasn't and still isn't the best browser out there but it does the job and is still the fasted solution on my old Powerbook. While I use Safari for my daily browsing I still keep a copy of Firefox for web development stuff. I just can't miss the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" title="Firefox Web Developer extension" class="ext">Web Developer</a> toolbar or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" title="Firefox Firebug extension" class="ext">Firebug</a> extensions!</p>

  <p>Why all this advertising for Firefox? Well, it's <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/" title="Firefox Download Day 2008" class="ext">Firefox Download Day 2008</a> today and they need all the support they can get to help set the record for most software downloads in 24 hours. The official date for the launch of Firefox 3 is <abbr title="2008-06-17T10:00:00-08">June 17, 2008 at 10 AM</abbr> but that's <abbr title="Pacific Standard Time">PST</abbr> or San Francisco time. So in Belgium the Firefox Download Day will start at <abbr title="2008-06-17T10:00:00+1">7 PM</abbr>. Check this time in <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=6&day=17&year=2008&hour=10&min=0&sec=0&p1=224&sort=1" title="June 17, 2008 at 10 AM in your time zone" class="ext">your time zone</a>.</p>

  <p>Firefox is a free download for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, but I didn't need to tell you that.</p>

  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Mozilla's CEO <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn ext" href="http://john.jubjubs.net/">John Lilly</a><span class="org hidden">Mozilla Corporation</span></span> posted an <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/06/18/firefox-3s-first-24-hours/" title="Firefox 3's First 24 Hours" class="ext">update</a> on the Firefox Download Day. Firefox 3 was downloaded 8 million times in its first 24 hours. At its peak, the server was sending out Firefox 3 copies at 17,000 downloads per minute! He also states that Firefox market share has grown to about 4%, an impressive number 24 hours after the release.</p>
