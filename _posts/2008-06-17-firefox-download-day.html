<p>I’m a Mac user and after Mac OS X Leopard came out, I switched back to Safari. Admittedly, it wasn’t and still isn’t the best browser out there, but it does the job and feels fast on my old Powerbook. While I use Safari for my daily browsing, I keep a copy of Firefox for web development stuff. Nothing beats the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" title="Firefox Web Developer extension">Web Developer</a> toolbar or Firebug extensions!</p>

<p>Why all this advertising for Firefox? Well, it’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618002116/http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/" title="Firefox Download Day 2008">Firefox Download Day 2008</a> and they need all the support they can get to help set the record for most software downloads in 24 hours. The official date for the launch of Firefox 3 is <time datetime="2008-06-17T10:00-08:00">June 17, 2008, at 10 AM</time> but that’s <abbr title="Pacific Standard Time">PST</abbr> or San Francisco time. In Belgium, the Firefox Download Day will start at <time datetime="2008-06-17T10:00:00+01:00">7 PM</time>.</p>

<p>Firefox is a free download for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, but I didn’t need to tell you that.</p>

<p>Mozilla’s <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> <a class="h-card" href="http://john.jubjubs.net/">John Lilly</a> posted an <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/06/18/firefox-3s-first-24-hours/" title="Firefox 3’s First 24 Hours">update</a> on the Firefox Download Day. Firefox 3 was downloaded 8 million times in its first 24 hours. At its peak, the server was sending out copies at 17,000 downloads per minute! He also writes Firefox’s market share has grown to about 4%, an impressive number 24 hours after the release.</p>
