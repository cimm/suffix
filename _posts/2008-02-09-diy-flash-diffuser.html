  <p>I do have a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=141&modelid=11923" class="ext" title="Canon Speedlite 430EX flash">good flash</a> for my DSLR but I'm always reluctant to take it out of my bag, mount it on the camera and carry the heavy package around. After reading something about a business card taped on your flash as a free diffuser I gave it a try.</p>

  <p>Take some white paperboard (I used the inside of a packaging box) and cut it to the following dimensions. The dimensions are fine for my <a href="http://www.canon-europe.com/eos400d/" title="Official Canon EOS 400D website" class="ext">Canon EOS 400D</a> but the principle should work for any camera with the same built-in flash layout. Fold the card on the dotted line and strengthen the bottom part with some duck-tape.</p>
