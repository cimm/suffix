After reading something about a business card taped on your flash as a free diffuser I gave it a try.</p>

  <p>Take some white paperboard (I used the inside of a packaging box) and cut it to the following dimensions. The dimensions are fine for my Canon EOS 400D but the principle should work for any camera with the same built-in flash layout. Fold the card on the dotted line and strengthen the bottom part with some duck-tape.</p>
