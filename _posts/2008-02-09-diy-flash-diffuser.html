<p>I have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100515175637/https://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=141&modelid=11923">good flash</a> for my <abbr title="Digital Single-lens Reflex Camera">DSLR</abbr> but I’m always reluctant to take it out of the bag, mount it on the camera and carry the heavy package around. After reading something about a business card taped on your flash as a free diffuser, I tried it.</p>

<p>Take some white cardboard and cut it to the following dimensions. The dimensions are for a Canon EOS 400D but the principle should work for any camera with a hot shoe. Fold the card on the dotted line and strengthen the bottom part with tape.</p>

<p>That’s all there is, really. Open the flash, slide the card in the hot shoe and start shooting. See the difference? The first photo is without a diffuser card, the second one with diffuser.</p>
