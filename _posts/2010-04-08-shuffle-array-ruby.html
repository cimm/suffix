description: A quick look at the ‘shuffle’, ‘rand’ and ‘sample’ array methods in Ruby.
---

<p>I needed to randomly sort the elements in a Ruby on Rails array for a project I’m working on. Turns out these things are just way too easy in Ruby:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
[1, 2, 3].shuffle
>> [3, 1, 2]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Credits to <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014104534/http://www.tomklaasen.net/">Tom Klaasen</a></span> to improve the more complex snippet I had earlier.</p>

<p>There is also a ‘rand’ method when you only need a single element and don’t need to shuffle the whole array in Ruby 1.8.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
[1, 2, 3].rand
>> 3
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Or in Ruby 1.9.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
[1, 2, 3].sample
>> 3
{% endhighlight %}
