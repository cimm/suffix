<p>I needed to randomly sort the elements in an array in the Ruby on Rails project I'm working on.</p>

<p>Turns out these things are just way too easy in Ruby:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
[1, 2, 3].shuffle
>> [3, 1, 2]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Credits to <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014104534/http://www.tomklaasen.net/">Tom Klaasen</a></span> for improving the more complex snippet I found before.</p>

<p>Or you can use the rand method when you only need one single element and don't need to shuffle the whole array in Ruby 1.8:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
[1, 2, 3].rand
>> 3
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And for Ruby 1.9:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
[1, 2, 3].sample
>> 3
{% endhighlight %}
