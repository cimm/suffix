<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>Every Bitcoin <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address" title="Address @ Bitcoin wiki">address</a> has a public and private key. These matching keys are derived from the address using mathematical operations. You don't need to know the keys of an address for a simple transaction using one of the <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet" title="Choose your Bitcoin wallet">wallets</a>; the keys are used but hidden from the user.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you might need them, though. Say you want to release the funds in a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address#Multi-signature_addresses" title="Multi-signature addresses @ Bitcoin wiki">multisig</a> address, for example, until the popular clients add better support for multisig transactions.</p>

  <p>But how do you find the keys associated with an address?</p>

  <p>Using the Bitcoin Core (previously named Bitcoin-Qt) client, you open the &lsquo;Debug window&rsquo; and switch to the &lsquo;Console&rsquo; tab. Use the prompt to inspect an address:</p>

  {% highlight bash %}
  validateaddress misCbzYUNyWGci7zzGB4hRJEDatwApdnvH
  {
    "isvalid" : true,
    "address" : "misCbzYUNyWGci7zzGB4hRJEDatwApdnvH",
    "ismine" : true,
    "isscript" : false,
    "pubkey" : "0329e8a14994ec7ce9..42fe42765bd4112",
    "iscompressed" : true,
    "account" : ""
  }
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>This first command (<code>validateaddress</code>) will list some bits of information about the address; one of them is the public key.</p>

  <p>The second one, <code>dumpprivkey</code>, gives you the private key:</p>

  {% highlight bash %}
  dumpprivkey misCbzYUNyWGci7zzGB4hRJEDatwApdnvH
  cTECm13QtyF3WEmQyomkmNEXySYF1f6hMHDUuYS7iaKdV5VMg2rB
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Keep this one safe. A private key should be kept, well, private, or you risk losing your coins!</p>
