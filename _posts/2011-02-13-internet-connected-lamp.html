  <p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEbMV295Kk" title="Video: The Internet of Things explained">Internet of Things</a> is the idea of an internet of devices: your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111201050916/http://www.ambientdevices.com/products/umbrella.html" title="Ambient Umbrella by Ambient Devices">umbrella</a> could glow when it will rain or you could get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111218165354/http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html" title="Ambient Orb by Ambient Devices">lamp</a> that uses color to show weather forecasts. Cool, but it costs $150 and is sold out. Any chance we can make one ourselves?</p>

  <p>What follows is my very first Arduino project, feel free to comment and improve wherever you see fit.</p>

  <h2>Project outline</h2>

  <p>Let&apos;s keep it simple for now. We&apos;ll put a red and green <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> in the lamp that we can control separately via <abbr title="Unviversal Serial Bus">USB</abbr>. This will allow us to show whatever information we can translate in a simple red or green. Some possible use cases:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Will it rain tomorrow? Yes or no?</li>
    <li>Is my train delayed? Yes or no?</li>
    <li>Do I have new e-mail? Yes or no?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This list is endless of course and that&apos;s exactly why we build it ourselves. Maybe you want to be notified when there is a traffic jam on your way to work? No problem.</p>

  <h2>The wiring</h2>

  <p>The Arduino will serve as a serial port between the computer and the lamp. It will translate the &ldquo;turn green&rdquo; command to a high voltage on one of the Arduino pins. The &ldquo;turn red&rdquo; command is exactly the same but uses another pin. The resistor will make sure we don&apos;t burn the <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr>s.</p>

  <p>Connect the 5 wires as shown:</p>

  <p>Hide the <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr>s and wires in the lamp (together with the Arduino if you can) and connect the <abbr title="Unviversal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable to the computer.</p>

  <h2>The Arduino software</h2>

  <p>We need some software on the Arduino which will listen to serial commands on the connected <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable and send a high voltage to the green or red pin when the computer tells it so. Download the <a href="https://github.com/cimm/orb" title="Orb source code at Github" rel="me">Orb Arduino sketch</a> and upload it to the Arduino.</p>

  <p>The Arduino will now listen for the command &ldquo;G&rdquo;. The capital G will turn the green <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> on, and the red off. Everything else will turn the red one on and the green one off. Turning on the green <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> means it will set pin 10 (green) to HIGH and ping 13 (red) to LOW.</p>

  <h2>The computer software</h2>

  <p>Now we need something to tell the Arduino which <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> it should turn on. Download the Ruby <a href="https://github.com/cimm/orb" title="Orb source code at Github" rel="me">orbifier script</a>.</p>

  <p>At the time of writing, there are 3 parsers: a Yahoo! Weather forecast parser, a Belgian train delay parser, and a Gmail new mail parser. Feel free to write your own if you want. The parser will check online and send &ldquo;G&rdquo; to the Arduino of it wants to turn on the green light, it will send &ldquo;R&rdquo; if it wants the red light turned on.</p>

  <p>You should be good to go. Run one of the orbifier parsers to turn on the light. Check for new e-mail for example:</p>

  <code>./orbifier gmail -p /usb/tty.usbmodem441 -a example@gmail.com -s 12345</code>

  <h2>What&apos; next?</h2>

  <p>The next step would be to add a wireless shield to the Arduino so that the computer isn&apos;t needed anymore (for now you are limited by the length of the cable between the Arduino and the computer).</p>
