<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEbMV295Kk" title="Video: The Internet of Things explained" class="ext">Internet of Things</a> is the idea of an internet of devises: your <a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/products/umbrella.html" title="Ambient Umbrella by Ambient Devices" class="ext">umbrella</a> could glow when it will rain or you could get a <a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html" title="Ambient Orb by Ambient Devices" class="ext">lamp</a> that uses color to show weather forecasts. Cool, but it costs $150 and is sold out. Any chance we can make one ourselves?</p>

<p>What follows is my very first Arduino project, feel free to comment and improve wherever you see fit.</p>

<h3>Project outline</h3>

<p>Let&apos;s keep it simple for now. We&apos;ll put a red and green <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> in the lamp that we can control separately via <abbr title="Unviversal Serial Bus">USB</abbr>. This will allow us to show whatever information we can translate in a simple red or green. Some possible use cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will it rain tomorrow? Yes or no?</li>
  <li>Is my train delayed? Yes or no?</li>
  <li>Do I have new e-mail? Yes or no?</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is endless of course and that&apos;s exactly why we build it ourselves. Maybe you want to be notified when there is a traffic jam on your way to work? No problem.</p>

<h3>The wiring</h3>

<p>The Arduino will serve as a serial port between the computer and the lamp. It will translate the &ldquo;turn green&rdquo; command to a high voltage on one of the Arduino pins. The &ldquo;turn red&rdquo; command is exactly the same but uses another pin. The resistor will make sure we don&apos;t burn the <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr>s.</p>

<p>Connect the 5 wires as shown :</p>

<img src="https://github.com/cimm/orb/raw/master/schema.png" alt="Arduino wiring schema" />

<p>Hide the <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr>s and wires in the lamp (together with the Arduino if you can) and connect the <abbr title="Unviversal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable to the computer.</p>

<h3>The Arduino software</h3>

<p>We need some software on the Arduino which will listen to serial commands on the connected <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable and send a high voltage to the green or red pin when the computer tells it so. Download the <a href="https://github.com/cimm/orb" title="Orb source code at Github" rel="me" class="ext">Orb Arduino sketch</a> and upload it to the Arduino.</p>

<p>The Arduino will now listen for the command &ldquo;G&rdquo;. The capital G will turn the green <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> on, and the red off. Everything else will turn the red one on and the green one off. Turning on the green <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> means it will set pin 10 (green) to HIGH and ping 13 (red) to LOW.</p>

<h3>The computer software</h3>

<p>Now we need something to tell the Arduino which <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> it should turn on. Download the Ruby <a href="https://github.com/cimm/orb" title="Orb source code at Github" rel="me" class="ext">orbifier script</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing there are 3 parsers: a Yahoo! Weather forecast parser, a Belgian train delay parser, and a Gmail new mail parser. Feel free to write your own if you want. The parser will check online and send &ldquo;G&rdquo; to the Arduino of it wants to turn on the green light, it will send &ldquo;R&rdquo; if it wants the red light turned on.</p>

<p>You should be good to go. Run one of the orbifier parsers to turn on the light. Check for new e-mail for example:</p>

<code>./orbifier gmail -p /usb/tty.usbmodem441 -a example@gmail.com -s 12345</code>

<h3>What&apos; next?</h3>

<p>The next step would be to to add a wireless shield to the Arduino so that the computer isn&apos;t needed anymore (for now you are limited by the length of the cable between the Arduino and the computer).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/cimm/orb" title="Orb source code at Github" rel="me" class="ext">project page</a> at Github contains the source code for both the Arduino and computer part and some more detailed information.</li>
  <li>Here are some more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/schoeters/tags/orb/" class="ext" rel="me">photos</a> form the finished project.</li>
