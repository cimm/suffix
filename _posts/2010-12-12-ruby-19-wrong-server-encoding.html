<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>Last week I tried to port an old Rails application form Ruby 1.8 to the latest 1.9. My development environment - a Mac OS X Snow Leopard machine - was running fine but the server just didn't want to show the French version of the site. Each time I tried to switch the English locale to the French one it died with the following error:</p>

  <samp>Encoding::CompatibilityError: incompatible character encodings: UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1</samp>

  <p>It took me a while to find out what went wrong: the server wasn't configured for UTF-8.</p>

  <h2>Finding the current locale</h2>

  <p>You can get the current locale on an Ubuntu box with the <em>locale</em> command:</p>

  <samp>LANG=<br />
  LC_CTYPE="en_US"<br />
  &hellip;<br />
  LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US"<br />
  LC_ALL=</samp>

  <h2>Installing missing locales</h2>

  <p>Now, assume the Ruby 1.9 application needs the UTF-8 locale. First check if the needed locale is installed on the system with the <em>locale -a</em> command (shows a list with all available locales). If no UTF-8 locale is installed you can generate one with:</p>

  <samp>$ locale-gen en_US.UTF-8</samp>

  <p>To change the locale used by your system, modify the file <em>/etc/default/locale</em> to contain, for example:</p>

  <samp>LANG="en_US.UTF-8"</samp>

  <p>Reboot the system and there you go... Ruby 1.9 should now be smart enough to use UTF-8 strings by default.</p>

  <p>Thanks <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn nickname" href="http://twitter.com/jbpros"><span class="given-name">@jbpros</span></a></span> for pointing me in the right direction!</p>
