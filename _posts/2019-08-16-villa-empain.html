<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>Baron Louis Empain, the second son of <a href="#edouard-empain" title="Jump to section about Édouard Empain below">Édouard Empain</a>, was interested in Art Deco architecture. At <time datetime="1930">22 years</time> old he commissions Michel Polak, a Swiss architect living in Belgium, to build a villa at Avenue Franklin Roosevelt 67 in Brussels. Construction finished <time datetime="1934">4 years</time> later in <time>1934</time>. Louis only lived here for 6 months before moving to Canada. He donates the property to the Belgian state in <time>1937</time> intending to open a museum of contemporary decorative arts.</p>

  <p>The outbreak of World War II decides otherwise and the villa is occupied by the Germans in <time>1943</time>. After the war, the villa is used as the embassy of the <abbr title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">USSR</abbr>, not to the liking of the Empain family, who retakes ownership in the <time datetime="1960">60s</time>. The villa changes owners many times over the following years. In the <time datetime="1980">80s</time> the villa is deserted and falls in disarray. In <time>2006</time> the <a href="http://www.boghossianjewels.com/en/house-of-boghossian/foundation/" title="The Villa Empain @ Boghossian Foundation">Boghossian Foundation</a> renovates the villa and, <time datetime="2010">4 years later</time>, opens it to the public.</p>

  <h2 id="edouard-empain">Baron Édouard Empain</h2>
  <p>Baron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Empain" title="Édouard Empain @ Wikipedia">Édouard Empain</a>, the father of Louis, was a wealthy Belgian industrialist and amateur Egyptologist. He is known for building the Paris Métro and a new city: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis,_Cairo" title="Heliopolis, Cairo, Egypt @ Wikipedia">Heliopolis</a>, now a suburb of Cairo where he also build a palace (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Empain_Palace" title="Baron Empain Palace @ Wikipedia">Palais Hindou</a>). His wealth came from the metallurgy sector: his enterprises built tramlines in Russia, China, Belgian Congo, and Egypt. He even founded his own bank.</p>
