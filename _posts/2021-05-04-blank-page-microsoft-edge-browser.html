<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge" title="Microsoft Edge @ Wikipedia">Edge</a> is Microsoft’s flagship browser, replacing Internet Explorer 11. Recent Edge versions are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)" title="Chromium web browser @ Wikipedia">Chromium</a>, meaning it’s using the same engine as Google Chrome but rebranded by Microsoft. As a web developer I have been using Edge on and off and generally like it. It feels at home on Windows 10 and is such a fresh departure from the whole Internet Explorer age. Way back we even build a website that would only render in grayscale on Internet Explorer 6 for fun and giggles, but I digress.</p>

<h2>Home Page & Privacy</h2>

<p>Earlier today I got annoyed with accepting cookies on the MS Edge default home page. It loads each time you start the browser or open a new tab and I caught myself thinking: “If you value my privacy so much… why the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/" title="Seems github, owned by Microsoft, knows how">cookie banner</a>? Why even load a page from Microsoft’s servers each time I open a new tab?” Edge is not the first browser I use in my life so quickly changing the homepage to a blank page should only take me a few seconds, right?</p>

<h2>Changing the Home Page</h2>

<p>It took some internet searching to understand you need to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/change-your-browser-home-page-a531e1b8-ed54-d057-0262-cc5983a065c6" title="change your browser home page @ Microsoft Edge Support">customize</a> the start page and manually type “about:blank” in the text field. A bit embarrassing as a professional web developer, don’t you think? I can’t remember it was that hard in, I don’t know, Internet Explorer 6? I restarted the browser and it shows a clean, blank page!</p>

<p>I open a new tab and… the Microsoft search page is back. Fine, I probably missed a setting somewhere. More digging around the interwebs. Wait. As far as I can <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/msedge_search-msedge_win10/open-new-tab-with-completely-blank-page-in-edge/c843ee34-fa41-4b0a-8707-8ab5c6004953" title="Open new tab with completely blank page in Edge @ Microsoft Community">tell</a> you need to install a 3<sup>rd</sup> party extension, which you need to download from the Google Chrome store, to set a blank page on new tabs.</p>

<p>Really Microsoft?</p>
