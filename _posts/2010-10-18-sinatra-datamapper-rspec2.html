<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>Earlier today I was trying to get up to speed with Sinatra, DataMapper and RSpec. There is a great <a href="http://iamneato.com/2009/08/01/rspec-and-sinatra-quick-start" title="RSpec and Sinatra Quick Start" class="ext">step by step tutorial</a> for Sinatra and RSpec 1 if your need that, but I want to play with the shiny new stuff, so here we go.</p>

  <h2>Bundler</h2>

  <p>You don't have to use Bundler but it will make your (and your collaborators) gem dependencies so much easier. Start with creating a Gemfile in your project's root folder and add the gems you need.</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  source :rubygems

  gem "sinatra"
  gem "dm-sqlite-adapter"
  gem "datamapper"

  group :test do
    gem "rspec"
    gem "rack-test"
  end
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Now run <em>bundle install</em> (check the <a href="http://gembundler.com/" title="Bundler installation instructions" class="ext">Bundler docs</a> for installation instructions). This will install the gems specified above and create a Gemfile.lock file in the same directory.</p>

  <h2>RSpec</h2>

  <p>Let's configure RSpec. Create a <em>spec</em> directory in your project's root folder with a <em>spec_helper.rb</em> and <em>myapp_spec.rb</em> file (replace myapp with your app's name). Now, add the following to the <em>spec_helper.rb</em> file:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'myapp.rb')

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'sinatra'
  require 'rack/test'
  require 'rspec'

  set :environment, :test

  Rspec.configure do |config|
    config.before(:each) { DataMapper.auto_migrate! }
  end
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>The first line requires your Sinatra application (again, rename it with your application). The following lines require the stuff we need to run the tests and after that we set the environment. The last 3 lines reset the database before each test to make sure our tests don't influence one another.</p>

  <p>Let's move on to the <em>myapp_spec.rb</em>:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/spec_helper'

  describe 'MyApp' do
    include Rack::Test::Methods

    def app
      Sinatra::Application
    end

    it 'should run a simple test' do
      get '/'
      last_response.status.should == 200
    end
  end
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>This is where your tests go, how this works is not the scope of this tutorial. You can now run the test with <em>RACK_ENV=test rspec .</em> (that's a dot at the end).</p>

  <h2>Databases</h2>

  <p>If you don't specify another database it will use the same database for each environment. The data will be cleared each time. You can use the following snippet to use different database configurations per environment. Add this to your main application file.</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  DataMapper.setup(:default, "postgres://localhost/myapp")
  configure :test do
    DataMapper.setup(:default, "sqlite::memory:")
  end
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>That's all, happy testing everyone. :)</p>
