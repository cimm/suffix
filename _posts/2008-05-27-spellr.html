<p>Spellr is a new web application by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081103041303/http://www.melon.com.au/" title="Melon Media, corporate online marketing Australia">Melon Media</a> that automatically checks websites for spelling mistakes. Last week I received my beta account, and it works great, apart from some minor glitches (that’s why it’s called beta, no?). Spellr currently supports English (International, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>, Canadian), French, Italian, Spanish and German.</p>

<p>You start a scan from their website and 2 minutes later—this website counts around 100 small pages—you can check the generated report. I scanned this blog a couple of times now and caught <del>quiet</del> quite a few mistakes. The quality seems good but returns too many errors for the technical jargon used on this website, more on that later. I’m sure there are still more mistakes to be discovered here as my English is far from perfect, so this is a welcome tool for me.</p>

<p>There are no pricing details available yet, but Melon Media promises free scans for ‘small’ websites, whatever that may be.</p>

<h2>What’s missing?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Custom dictionaries</strong>: not yet available today but Spellr is working on that. This would be a wonderful way to tell Spellr to ignore specific words that are not spelling mistakes as such (technical jargon for example). This feature will only be available for the paid version, which is unfortunate as it’s the only feature I’ll be missing in the free version.</li>
  <li><strong>Case insensitive checks</strong>: the tags on this website are all in lower cases and Spellr thinks they are wrong. The possibility to ignore cases would be nice.</li>
  <li><strong>Scheduled searches</strong>: not available in beta yet but also planned for the final release. This will be one of Spellr most useful features to me. Schedule your search and receive spelling mistakes via <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>.</li>
  <li><strong>Grammar checks</strong>: not supported yet bet also on their list.</li>
  <li><strong>Ping system</strong>: something like Technorati to inform Spellr that the website has changed.</li>
</ul>
