  <p>On May, 15th <a href="http://www.pitslamp.be">Filip</a> and I organize <abbr title="The Way Internet Is Supposed To Be">twiist.be</abbr> an affordable one day conference for like-minded web creatives in Leuven, Belgium.</p>

  <h2>Where?</h2>

  <p class="vevent"><abbr title="2009-05-15T09:00+01:0000" class="dtstart">May, 15th</abbr>, <span class="location"><abbr class="geo" title="50.8772,4.71681">Provinciehuis</abbr>, Leuven</span><abbr title="2009-05-15T18:15+01:00" class="dtend hidden">6:15pm</abbr>. Easy to reach by public transport and close to Brussels.</p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>Well, we love conferences... no seriously... we love the inspiring atmosphere at some conferences. The feeling that you have to try this little gem or play with that idea you just heard or even better: the feeling that you met a ton of interesting people you want to invite for a coffee and involve in your next great web, iPhone, Android or whatever app or design.</p>

  <p>One problem though: most of these conferences are way to expensive for normal people like us (@media) or too far away (<abbr title="South by Southwest">SXSW</abbr>). A few years ago the <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/">ClearLeft</a> folks started something small and inspiring in <abbr title="50.8237,-0.138619">Brighton</abbr>, UK: called dConstruct. We are loyal participants ever since. As there is nothing like this in Belgium we thought it would be nice to have something similar closer to home.</p>

  <h2>Speakers?</h2>

  <p>This is the best part! I'm still impressed with the line-up we gathered, have a look for yourself: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090419212503/http://www.twiist.be/speakers/aralbalkan" title="Aral Balkan's speakers bio and presentation topic">Aral Balkan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090301170420/http://twiist.be:80/speakers/sergejespers" title="Serge Jespers's speakers bio">Serge Jespers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090501061553/http://twiist.be:80/speakers/drewmclellan" title="Drew McLellan's speakers bio">Drew McLellan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090330081459/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/chrismessina" title="Chris Messina's speakers bio and presentation topic">Chris Messina</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090417165858/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/elliotjaystocks" title="Elliot Jay Stocks's speakers bio">Elliot Jay Stocks</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090417165858/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/briansuda" title="Brian Suda's speakers bio and presentation topic">Brian Suda</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090419071343/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/glennjones" title="Glenn jones' speakers bio and presentation topic">Glenn Jones</a>.</p>

  <h2>Tickets?</h2>

  <p>No plans on the 15th yet? Get a conference pass for &euro;100 (excl. <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) and say hi when you find the most stressful person at the venue.</p>

  <p>Oh, by the way, the conference will be in English only. It's how Belgians organize something if there will be Dutch and French speaking people. ;)</p>
