<p>On <time datetime="2009-05-15">May 15<sup>th</sup></time> Filip Bunkens and I organize <abbr title="The Way Internet Is Supposed To Be">twiist.be</abbr> an affordable one-day conference for like-minded web creatives in Leuven, Belgium.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p class="h-event"><abbr title="2009-05-15T09:00+01:0000" class="dt-start">May 15<sup>th</sup></abbr>, <abbr class="geo p-location" title="50.8772,4.71681">Provinciehuis</abbr> Leuven. Easy to reach by public transport and close to Brussels.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>We love conferences, no seriously, we love the inspiring atmosphere at some conferences. The feeling that you must try this little gem or play with that idea you overheard or even better: the feeling that you met a ton of interesting people you want to invite for coffee and involve in your next great web, smartphone or whatever app or design.</p>

<p>One problem though: most of these conferences are too expensive for normal people (@media for example) or too far away (<abbr title="South by Southwest">SXSW</abbr>). A few years ago, the <a href="https://www.clearleft.com/">ClearLeft</a> folks started something small and inspiring in <abbr title="50.8237,-0.138619">Brighton</abbr>, UK: called <a href="http://dconstruct.org">dConstruct</a>. We have been loyal participants ever since. As there is nothing like this in Belgium, we thought it would be nice to have something similar closer to home.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>

<p>This is the best part. I’m impressed with the line-up we gathered, people like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090419212503/http://www.twiist.be/speakers/aralbalkan" title="Aral Balkan’s speakers bio and presentation topic" class="h-card" rel="met">Aral Balkan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090301170420/http://twiist.be:80/speakers/sergejespers" title="Serge Jespers’s speakers bio" class="h-card" rel="met">Serge Jespers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090501061553/http://twiist.be:80/speakers/drewmclellan" title="Drew McLellan’s speakers bio" class="h-card" rel="met">Drew McLellan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090330081459/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/chrismessina" title="Chris Messina’s speakers bio and presentation topic" class="h-card" rel="met">Chris Messina</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090417165858/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/elliotjaystocks" title="Elliot Jay Stocks’s speakers bio" class="h-card" rel="met">Elliot Jay Stocks</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090417165858/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/briansuda" title="Brian Suda’s speakers bio and presentation topic" class="h-card" rel="met">Brian Suda</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090419071343/http://www.twiist.be:80/speakers/glennjones" title="Glenn jones’ speakers bio and presentation topic" class="h-card" rel="met">Glenn Jones</a> already confirmed!</p>

<h2>Tickets</h2>

<p>No plans for the 15<sup>th</sup> yet? Get a conference pass for €100 (excl. <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) and say hi when you find the most stressful person at the venue.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, the conference will be in English only. It’s how Belgians organize something if there will be Dutch and French speaking people.</p>
