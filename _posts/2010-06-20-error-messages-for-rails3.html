description: Ruby on Rails 3 depreciates the ‘error_messages_for’ method.
---

<p>I played with the latest Rails 3 beta release today (version 3.0.0.beta4) and noticed the following depreciation warning:</p>

<samp>DEPRECATION WARNING: form.error_messages was removed from Rails and is now available as a plugin.</samp>

<p>Apparently the old ‘error_messages_for’ violated the core Rails principles of never dictating the look and feel of an application. Indeed, it includes fixed <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and copywriting, not good.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>The Rails core team decided to drop it completely as it’s just too easy to write a simple wrapper.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
<% if @post.errors.any? %>
  <ul>
    <% @post.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>
      <li><%= msg %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I hope this post saved someone a few minutes.</p>
