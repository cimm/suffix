<div class="narrow-col">
  <p><a href="http://2008.dconstruct.org/" title="dConstruct 2008">dConstruct 2008</a> is right around the corner: the Eurostar tickets are on my desk, the hostel in <abbr class="geo" title="50.8237;-0.138619">Brighton</abbr> is booked and the advertisement stuff is ready (more on this later). dConstruct by itself would be a good reason to be excited but this year there is a little extra. Last year <a class="h-card" href="http://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Fousa</a> and I took the dConstruct conference date as the deadline for our new sites (layout and codebase redesigns). This site went live right before we took of for dConstruct 2007 (<time datetime="20070905">September 5th, 2007</time>). Happy first birthday Suffix!</p>

  <p>Between <time datetime="20070901">September 1th, 2007</time> and <time datetime="20080903">yesterday</time> 6917 people visited this website from 103 different countries. They generated 10691 pageviews with 12 different browsers (only 2 <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" title="Google Chrome">Google Chrome</a> visitors so far). <a href="https://www.stumbleupon.com/" title="StumbleUpon">StumbleUpon</a> is my most successful referrer with <a href="https://www.flickr.com" title="Flickr Photo Sharing">Flickr</a> following close in second position.</p>

  <p>Last year I published 30 blog posts or an average of 2.5 per month. The “<a href="../lightroom-iphoto-export" title="Lightroom to iPhoto export">Lightroom to iPhoto export</a>” article is the most successful so far, “<a href="../ipodia" title="iPodia for Wikipedia">iPodia for Wikipedia</a>” the least successful. I write most about Apple, programming and Ruby on Rails.</p>

  <p>Anyway, probably not very useful for anyone but it’s just nice to keep around for myself and oh, happy 1<sup>st</sup> birthaday to <a class="h-card" href="http://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Fousa</a> as well!</p>
