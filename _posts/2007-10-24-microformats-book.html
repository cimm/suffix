    <p>“<span class="p-item">Microformats: Empowering Your Markup for Web 2.0</span>” is a clear and easily written introduction to <a href="http://microformats.org" title="A set of simple, open data formats">microformats</a> and semantic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> for beginners and solid reference work for advanced microformat users, written by <a class="h-card" href="http://johnfallsopp.com/">John Allsopp</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The very first book on microformats and I finally got my copy! I played with microformats before and have a bit of familiarity with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" title="Semantic web article on Wikipedia">semantic web</a> idea so not all concepts in the book were as useful to me but I would still recommend the book to more experienced web developers. Normally I’m not an <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> book minded person, these things tend to get hopelessly out of date before you find the time to read them. Especially with microformats, a newer concept to the web with lots of draft specifications, the book seems a dangerous field when you want to write something that lasts.</p>

    <p>It is the reason I bought John Allsop’s book (sells for a very reasonable <span class="p-price">£17</span> or ≈ €24): a trustworthy reference on my desk for when I see a possible microformat candidate popping up in my <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code. With the examples online there is always that “is this really the right way?” question. With a book you know that at least someone read the specifications (as John claims in his book) before writing it down. Especially when your technical editor is a guy like <a class="h-card" href="https://suda.co.uk/" rel="met">Brian Suda</a> and you have a chance to interview <a class="h-card" href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a>! By the way, did you know you can markup multi-dimensional tables in HTML? I didn’t.</p>

    <p>A good read for technical and non-technical readers alike, John’s “microformats and paving the cowpaths” comparison is definitely the most beautiful microformats definition I’ve seen.</p>

    <p>I would rate it <span class="p-rating">4</span> out of 5 stars. I need a complete <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hReview" title="hReview specification (depreciated)">hReview</a> post for this one, don’t I?</p>
