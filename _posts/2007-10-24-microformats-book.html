    <a href="http://microformatique.com/book/" class="fn url">Microformats: Empowering Your Markup for Web 2.0</a>
  </div>

  <p class="summary hidden">is a clear and easily written introduction to microformats and semantic HTML for beginners and a solid reference work for advanced microformat users.</p>

  <div class="description">

    <p>&lsquo;Microformats: Empowering Your Markup for Web 2.0&rsquo;, written by <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn ext" href="http://johnfallsopp.com/">John Allsopp</a></span>, or the very first book on <a href="http://microformats.org/" class="ext">microformats</a> and I finally got my copy!</p>

    <p>As I played with microformats before and am familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" title="Semantic web article on Wikipedia" class="ext">semantic web</a> idea not all concepts in the book were as useful as others but I would still recommend the book to more experienced web developers. Normally I'm not an IT book minded guy, these things tend to get hopelessly out of date before you find the time to read it and especially with microformats, a quite new concept to the web with lots of draft specifications, the book seems a dangerous field when you want to write something that lasts.</p>

    <p>With John Allsop's book this is exactly the reason why I bought it in the first place (except from the very reasonable &pound;17, around &euro;24, price tag). It's a trustworthy reference on my desk when I see a possible microformat candidate popping up in my <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code. With the examples you find around the web there is always that &lsquo;is this really the right way?&rsquo; question. With a book you know that at least someone read the specifications (as John claims in his book) before writing something down. Especially when your technical editor is a guy like <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn ext" href="http://suda.co.uk/" rel="met">Brian Suda</a></span> and you have a chance to interview <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn ext" href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a></span>! By the way, did you know you can markup multi-dimensional tables in HTML? I didn't...</p>

    <p>Not only very clear for both technical and non-technical readers but John's &lsquo;microformats and paving the cowpaths&rsquo; comparison is definitely the most beautiful microformats definition I heard.</p>

    <p>I would rate it <abbr title="4" class="rating">4</abbr> out of 5 stars. I need a complete hReview post for this one, don't I?</p>
