  <p>A few months ago, I got a padlock and some lockpicking tools. I might have watched a bit too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm9K6rby98W8JigLoZOh6FQ" title="Lock Picking Lawer YouTube Channel">LockPickingLawyer</a> videos.</p>

  <p>Lockpicking is the art of opening a lock in ways that weren’t intended by its designers. There are many ways to beat a lock without using a key: <a href="http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Bumping">bumping</a>, <a href="http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Loiding">loiding</a>, <a href="http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Raking">raking</a>, picking, <a href="http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Shimming">shimming</a>, impressing, or simply breaking the lock with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBSSA5ot0tA" title="LockPickingLawyer video 753: You’re Doing it Wrong... The REAL Double Wrench Method">wrenches</a>.</p>

  <h2>But why?</h2>

  <p>Why do people make puzzles or solve sudokus? Lockpicking is similar: it’s challenging and you pick up a new skill. I like fumbling with the padlocks while watching a movie. Some locks are easier to beat than others, same as puzzles really, you can “level up” by moving on to a more difficult one once you get the hang of it.</p>

  <p>It’s also a way to show my kids security isn’t absolute. They got interested in my new toy and quickly learned to rake open the practice padlock. Their faces when they realized locks can be bypassed so easily made my day! A good moment to explain a lock might slow down but won’t stop a bike thief. A lesson learned, with a bigger impact than my usual ramblings.</p>

  <h2>Is lockpicking legal?</h2>

  <p>“Wait… are you teaching your kids to break in? Is this even legal!?”</p>
  <p>Honestly? I don’t know. It seems legal in most of the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, but I live in Belgium and couldn’t find if it is. There used to be a local <a href="https://toool.nl/Toool.org" title="TOOOL chapters around the world">TOOOL BE</a> chapter until <time>2017</time>, so I suppose it is? Do your own <a href="http://lockwiki.com/index.php/Legal_Issues" title="List of legal issues around lockpicking around the world">research</a>.

  <p>“Even if it’s legal, it’s not ethical.”</p>

  <p>First, and that goes without saying, I only pick locks I own and are not in use. Secondly, I believe lockpicking is not (often) used to break in. It’s easier to smash a window or cut through the lock than to pick it. When they broke into our place years ago, two hits with a screwdriver was all they needed to get in through the back door. Still, is it ethically correct to show kids how to pick a lock? I am a programmer. How can I write (reasonably) safe software if I don’t know how it might get attacked? I strongly believe it’s better to know the weak points instead of pretending they don’t exist.</p>

  <h2>Getting started</h2>

  <p>Want to learn how to pick locks? You’ll need a pick and tension wrench to start with. Or use a paperclip, but I haven’t tried those (yet). Most online stores referenced on the interwebs are US-oriented. I bought mine at <a href="https://store.spooxe.com" title="German lockpicking store">spooxe</a> in Germany since shipping and taxes are cheaper from a European store. <a href="https://lock401.com" title="LOCK401: Online lockpicking store">LOCK401</a> is also shipping from Europe (France?), but I haven’t used them.</p>

  <p>Once you have your tools you can watch any of the numerous online videos or read “<a href="http://www.capricorn.org/~akira/home/lockpick/">The Document Which Used To Be Called The MIT Lockpicking Guide</a>” to learn everything about security and mushroom driver pins, or full diamond and snake rakes. It’s a great read.</p> 

  <h2>Starting locks</h2>

  <p>I randomly picked up a small <a href="https://www.masterlock.com/products/product/130D" title="Product page @ Master Lock">Master №130</a> padlock from the local hardware store as my first lock and it turned out it’s an easy one to pick. It took me 3 days or so the first time, and I can now reliably open it in under a minute. My next lock was an ABUS Buffo (<a href="http://lockwiki.com/index.php/Euro_Profile" title="A type of cylinder design predominately used in Europe">euro profile</a>) lock which proved to be a step up. It keeps me busy for a minute or two at my current level. My current nemesis is an <a href="https://www.abus.com/eng/Home-Security/Padlocks/TITALIUM/64-TITALIUM/(variant)/56203" title="Padlock 64TI/50 KD (article no. 56203) at ABUS">ABUS TITALIUM 64TI/50</a>. It has better manufacturing tolerances and I haven’t beaten it yet. Maybe, one day, I’ll even be good enough to pick the mythical <a href="http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Medeco_Biaxial" title="Medeco Biaxial @ LockWiki">Medeco Biaxial</a>.</p>
