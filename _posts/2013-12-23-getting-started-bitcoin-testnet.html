<p>You are a developer working on a <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org" title="Bitcoin, open source P2P money">Bitcoin</a> project or a power user discovering the more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA" title="The future of Bitcoin: new applications and rebuilding the banking system talk by Mike Hearn">advanced Bitcoin features</a>? This post explains how to get started with the Bitcoin <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet" title="What is this Bitcoin testnet you speak of?">testnet</a> so you can play without using your real, hard-earned coins.</p>

<p>None of the Bitcoin client applications implement all those features (yet) so you'll have to use the Bitcoin RPC interface from the command line.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p><a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download" title="Download Bitcoin-Qt">Download</a> and install the Bitcoin-Qt client. You can, but don't have to, start the application. It will start downloading the huge, real blockchain which you don't need for for testing.</p>

<h2>Configure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Find the Bitcoin-Qt <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory" title="Bitcoin-Qt data directories for each OS">data directory</a> for your system.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Create this directory if it doesn't exist yet (should be there when you did ran the client before). On Mac OS X for example:</p>
    <p><code>mkdir ~/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin/</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a <code><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin#Bitcoin.conf_Configuration_File" title="Configuration file options">bitcoin.conf</a></code> configuration file in that directory. A minimal example might look like:

{% highlight ini %}
testnet=1
server=1
rpcuser=Ulysseys
rpcpassword=YourPassword
rpctimeout=30
rpcport=8332
{% endhighlight %}
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Run</h2>

<p>Start the Bitcoin-Qt client. The application icon should be green instead of orange indicating it's running in testnet mode. The client will start downloading the testnet blockchain, this will take a while.</p>

<p>While you wait for the testnet blockchain to be downloaded you can grab some testnet coins. Find a Bitcoin <a href="http://faucet.xeno-genesis.com/" title="Mojocoin testnet faucet, one of many">testnet faucet</a> and send yourself some coins (you can find an address in the Bitcoin-Qt client).</p>

<p>The coins will only show up in the Bitcoin-Qt client application when the blockchain download has catched up, so wait for it to finish.</p>

<h2>Play</h2>

<p>Time to try it out. Here is a simple cURL command to ask the Bitcoin daemon for some general info using a JSON RPC:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
curl --user Ulysseys --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
{% endhighlight %}
