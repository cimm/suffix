<h2>Life Changes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Alcohol</p>
    <p>For reasons I can’t quite explain, I began tracking my alcohol consumption in 2025. While I don’t drink excessively—my wife and I stopped drinking alcohol at home when she was pregnant—I still enjoy a drink occasionally during social gatherings. This year, I logged 40 alcoholic consumptions using the iOS Health app, and surprisingly, it led to me drinking less. The simple act of keeping track seemed to unconsciously curb my consumption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running</p>
    <p>Throughout most of 2025, I met up with a friend once a week to run just over 5 kilometers. Nothing to write home about. However, come autumn, I decided to gradually increase my runs to three times a week, aiming to hit 10 kilometers by the end of the year. So far, so good—now I just need to keep it up to achieve some real distances in 2026.</p>

<h2>Reading & Writing</h2>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <p>Reading</p>
    <p><em>The Life of Puppets</em> by T.J. Klune was my favorite book discovery of the year. I shared my thoughts on the other books I read in my <a href="../2025-reading-list/" title="All the books I read in 2025">2025 Reading List</a>. Unfortunately, reading has remained mostly a holiday activity. I wish I could immerse myself in more books throughout the year, but life always seems to get in the way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing</p>
    <p>In 2025, I wrote 12 blog posts, including this one. While it’s not huge, I feel content as long as I keep writing a few times each year. It’s a fun way to look back on different phases of my life.</p>

<h2>Purchases</h2>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    <p>3D Printer</p>
    <p>I’ve contemplated getting a 3D printer for years, unsure whether it would be a useful tool or just an expensive toy once the novelty wore off. This year, I discovered that <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one-kit/" title="Prusa CORE ONE kit product page">Prusa</a> offers kits that you can assemble yourself. With my kids at the perfect age for this kind of project, it sounded like a fantastic opportunity—essentially, a grown-up LEGO kit. We <a href="../prusa-3d-printer/" title="My post about assembling the printer">built our first printer</a> together, and we had an absolute blast!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Slim Wallet</p>
    <p>A few months ago, I bought myself a <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/card-pocket?color=caramel" title="Bellroy Card Pocket product page">Bellroy Card Pocket</a> on a whim. It’s a slim wallet designed to hold around five credit cards and some pocket change. I even replaced my old booklet-style driver’s license with a new credit card-sized version for it to fit. This has probably been one of my best purchases this year, and I absolutely love it. If only it had <abbr title="Radio-Frequency IDentification">RFID</abbr> blocking.</p>

</ol>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>What I would like to achieve in 2026.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Carless</p>
    <p>In late autumn the car mechanic told us a routine maintenance would no longer cut it; more expensive repairs would be needed. We took this as an excuse to take a last trip to Switzerland with our car and sell it. We’ll try to get by without a car in 2026. We already do most by bike and public transport, but having a car is a convenience, of course. I am really looking forward to a carless life again; my family not so. We’ll see how this goes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marathon</p>
    <p>I hope to run a marathon with my dad next year; we’re aiming for the <a href="https://athorabrugesmarathon.com" title="Official Bruges Marathon website">Bruges Marathon</a> in October because the course is flat and close to home. Finishing a marathon with my father would be a personal highlight!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travel</p>
    <p>Plan a trip with the kids somewhere outside of Europe; they’ve been asking to visit some more exotic destinations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
