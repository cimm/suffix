<p>I use <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>, an online to-do list and task management application, to keep track of things as I tend to forget, well… almost everything. Thanks to <abbr title="Remember The Milk">RTM</abbr>’s <abbr title="Application Programming Interface ">API</abbr> the list of integrations with other systems is impressive: an <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/igoogle/" title="iGoogle Gadget">iGoogle gadget</a>, <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/gmail/" title="Remember The Milk for Gmail">Gmail</a> integration and <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/milksync/" title="MilkSync">Windows Mobile</a> syncing, just to name a few.</p>

<p>There is an <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/iphone/" title="Remember The Milk for iPhone and iPod Touch">iPhone interface</a> with one slight problem: you need a pro account if you want to use it after the 30-day trial period. As of yesterday, there is a solution! <a class="h-card" href="https://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Jelle Vandebeeck</a> a free iPhone interface for Remember The Milk.</p>

  <p>Find it hard to remember your daily tasks? Wonder if it’s possible to keep track of them wherever you are? Now you can! With this application, you’re able to check your tasks everywhere you go. Well, at least everywhere you have an <abbr title="Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution">EDGE</abbr> connection.</p>

  <p>You can add and delete tasks on the fly. Hey, you can even complete or postpone them. Every action is handled by a framework that connects to the ‘Remember The Milk’ server. Nothing is stored by the app but goes directly to the framework.</p>

<p>I have been beta testing his application over the last few days and it’s fantastic! The official RTM iPhone interface has more features but iFousa is an alternative for anyone who needs quick access to his tasks on the road. Did I mention it’s completely free? Try it and give Jelle some feedback, I’m sure he would appreciate it. The web app is written in Ruby on Rails, but that’s no surprise knowing Jelle.</p>

<p>At work, I use the RTM <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/2951/" title="Viewing your RTM lists in the Firefox Sidebar">iGoogle gadget in my Firefox sidebar</a> or the full website but iFousa is my preferred interface when I’m not at a computer. Thanks to RTM and iFousa I can manage (and remember) my to-do list wherever I am.</p>
