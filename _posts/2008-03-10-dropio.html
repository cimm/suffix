<p>I often share large files with others. The photos of last week’s dinner, a log file they need to check or that program I told you about. Sending files by mail is effortless but doesn’t always work since mail servers remove possibly malicious files and files over ±2<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr> aren’t always accepted (no idea why mail servers still think it’s <time>1990</time>).</p>

<p>Meet drop.io! Drop.io is a straightforward way to share larger files. You don’t need to create an account, leave your e-mail address or click through ads to upload or download a few files. You create a ‘drop’, a space where you will store the files, and that’s it.</p>

<p>A space can be password protected (but doesn’t have to), can expire after some period and you can set its permissions. The whole thing looks very Ruby on Rails like, even the layout hints at Rails.</p>

<p>I’m not claiming this is the best or only way (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080316141604/http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/04/26/options-for-backing-up-your-files/" title="Web Worker Daily looks at online backup solutions">online storage</a> is hot these days) to share files but it’s nice that someone finally understands how to share files nice and easy.</p>
