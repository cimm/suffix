<p>We have a boom gate at the parking lot in our coworking space. The gate can be opened with a button press from inside the office. Opening the gate is as simple as closing a circuit in the intercom, interesting. We wanted to simulate a button press on the intercom with an Arduino.</p>

<p>A quick look with the multimeter showed 12 volts on the gate circuit, nice, nothing we can't handle. We can't just wire the Arduino with the other circuit, a relay keeps them apart. Not having used relays before I started digging around and found <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Main/relays.pdf" title="Relays wiring diagram for Arduino" class="ext">this wiring diagram</a> on the Arduino site.</p>

<h3>An extra pin</h3>

<p>I got myself the cheapest and simplest relay I could get from my local electronics hobby shop, an Omron G2E PCB relay (<a href="http://www.datasheetarchive.com/G2E-184P-M-US-datasheet.html" title="Omron G2E PCB relay datasheets" class="ext">datasheet</a>).</p>

<p>The wiring diagram from the Arduino shows 5 connections on the relay, mine has 6. The datasheet shows the internal wiring but didn't make me any wiser, so how do you connect a relay?</p>

<h3>Reading the datasheet</h3>

<p>It turns out little rectangle on the bottom schematic view (between pin 2 and 5) in the relay datasheet represents the coil. Great, sending power over the coil should magnetize it and close the circuit, right? Well, I could hear the switch inside so something was working but it wasn't closing the other circuit, why?</p>

<p>It took me a little while to figer out why there are 6 pins: there is a normally closed pair and a normally open one. On top of that it's not pins [1,6] and [3,4] that form the switches as I expected but pins [1,3] and [6,4].</p>

<h3>Normally open / closed</h3>

<p>Connecting pins 6 and 4 creates a <strong>normally closed</strong> switch, the circuit is closed when the coil is not charged. This means anyting connected will be powered when the relay is in its normal state.</p>

<p>Connection pins 1 and 3, on the other hand, form the <strong>normally open</strong> switch. The switch is open when the coil is not charged. This is what we need for our button.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as you charge the coil (on pins 2 and 5) the switch will do what switches do: switch. Pins 6 and 4 will be interupted and pins 1 and 3 will be closed.</p>

<p>I suppose this is so simple that it isn't even worth mentioning but hey, maybe it saves someone somewhere a few minutes. I certainly learned something.</p>

<h3>Open Sesame</h3>

<p>Wanna know how the gate project, called Sesame, tuned out? There is a lot more info over on the <a href="https://github.com/DevSpace/sesame" title="Sesame project @ github" class="ext">DevSpace github project page</a>.</p>
