      <p>Blindly diving into this videogame shooter released in <time datetime="2019">2019</time>. <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/games/control" title="Control product page @ Remedy Games">Control</a> languished on my wishlist, nearly forgotten, until I snagged it for €9.99 on a Steam sale.</p>

      <p>The <time datetime="PT1H">first hour</time>, impressed so far. The opening level throws you into a desolate government building, instantly setting the game’s eerie atmosphere. Though clueless about your own purpose, a strange sense of belonging washes over you, pulling you deeper into the unknown. The brutalist architecture and <time datetime="1960">60s</time> vibes are stunning, but the weak, scarce enemies made me wonder if it’s more of a walking simulator than a shooter.</p>

      <p>A <time datetime="PT2H">few hours</time> in, the difficulty ramped up. It’s a shooter, alright. My trusty Service Weapon, the only gun you get, is probably the most awesome gun in any game. But here’s my first critique: interaction with the world feels limited. No picking up enemy weapons? Can’t use those med kits in the medical cabinets you rip out with satisfying violence? Immersion takes a hit.</p>

      <p>The lighting, though? Breathtaking. Back in <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, it was among the first to utilize real-time ray tracing, and it shows. Imagine an eerie dark room bathed in the green glow of an old <abbr title="Cathode-Ray Tube">CRT</abbr> monitor - stunning, but unfortunately fixed and indestructible. Asset reuse doesn’t help either. While the grandiose room designs compensated, identical offices with the same chairs and desks led to occasional moments of “have I been here before?”</p>

      <p>Around the <time datetime="PT5H">five-hour mark</time>, I assumed gameplay had plateaued. Repetitive grind, here I come? But wait… superpowers! This twist adds a thrilling new dimension to the game.</p>

      <p>Some <time datetime="PT5H">five hours</time> in, the story truly clicked. While I won’t spoil anything, the game blurs the lines between good and evil, keeping me constantly questioning the true motives of everyone involved. The <span property="author" typeof="Organization" resource="#remedy"><a property="url" href="https://www.remedygames.com/" title="Remedy Entertainment homepage" about="#remedy"><span property="name" about="#remedy">Remedy Entertainment</span></a></span> touch (creators of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake" title="Action-adventure video game aplauded for its story">Alan Wake</a>) is evident in the captivating narrative, where time-constrained side missions organically fit into the main story arc, even if their timing is often inconvenient (right in the middle of a mid-boss fight, seriously?).</p>

      <p>Over <time datetime="PT10H">10 hours</time> in. First time I notice this game throws away the minimap! Instead, you rely on a map for general direction, hints scattered around the level design, and your own memory to navigate. Sure, I sometimes got lost, but that became part of the fun.</p>

      <p>Enemy variety was decent, with the usual mix of heavy-hitters, agile foes, and flying nuisances. Backtracking annoyance came from enemies respawning in cleared areas, which made sense story-wise but felt tedious, especially without intermediate saves (the game auto-saves only at specific points).</p>

      <p>Puzzles! Not brain-busters, but enough to make you pause and appreciate the world-building. They are mostly pattern-matching variations, but the diversity keeps them engaging. The collectibles (letters and audio tapes) are optional and don’t impact gameplay, but they enrich the story for lore-hungry players.</p>

      <p>At around the <time datetime=PT15H">15-hour</time> mark, I reached the <a href="https://breezewiki.com/control/wiki/Ashtray_Maze" title="Ashtray Maze level description @ breeze wiki">Ashtray Maze</a>. As I finished the level, I thought to myself, “This is awesome!”. Coincidentally, at the same moment, the protagonist echoed my sentiment, exclaiming, “That was awesome!” Undoubtedly, this level stands out as the game’s highlight.</p>

      <p>After roughly <time datetime="PT18H">18 hours</time> of enthralling gameplay, the main story reached its conclusion, though not quite the ending I expected. The story takes a rather downbeat turn at the close.</p>

      <p><span property="name" about="#control">Control</span> has stolen a place in my favorite shooters’ hall of fame. <span property="reviewRating" typeof="Rating"><meta property="bestRating" content="5"><meta property="ratingValue" content="4">It’s a grandiose, stunning, and ultimately brilliant trip that shouldn’t be missed!</span></p>
