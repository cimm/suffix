<p>I have always been fascinated by dashboards. I used to run a <a href="https://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sample" title="A dashboard framework by Shopify written in Ruby">Dashing</a> dashboard at one of my earlier jobs and the animated colorful tiles made our application that little more tangible.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb" title="A datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics">InfluxDB</a>, an open-source time series database and dashboard. The screenshots look nice so I have been wanting to kick its tires. I already read the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature from my cheap CO<sub>2</sub> monitor so I combined the two in the colorful dashboard shown above.</p>

<p>InfluxDB is the database and dashboard part. It keeps the data in so called ‘buckets’ with a configurable retention policy and has a webUI to easily build beautiful dashboards. New metrics can be stored in InfluxDB via a <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, but the default seems to be via <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/" title="Metric collection agent for InfluxDB">Telegraf</a>, a single no-dependency binary to collect, filter and send metrics to InfluxDB. The lightweight Telegraf agent is installed on the systems you want to collect metrics from.</p>

<p>I installed NixOS 21.11 with InfluxDB 2.0.8 on an old laptop as a quick test. Disclaimer: all the cool kids are playing with NixOS and this was my first experience with both NixOS and InfluxDB so take the following with a grain of salt.</p>

<h2>InfluxDB</h2>

<p>This could not have been easier. Add the ‘influxdb2’ package, enable the service and (optionally) open port 8086.</p>

{% highlight nix %}
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  influxdb2
]
services.influxdb2.enable = true;
networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 8086 ];
{% endhighlight %}
<p><em>↑ Adding InfluxDB to NixOS’ configuration.conf</em></p>

<p>A quick ‘nixos-rebuild switch’ and we are good to go. InfluxDB can be configured via the webUI at localhost:8086 (replace ‘localhost’ with the IP address if not on the same machine). Create a new user, organization and a first bucket to store metrics in. I have a ‘test’ bucket with a retention policy of a few days and a ‘home’ one with a longer retention to store sensor data from around the house.</p>

<p>Metrics can be sent to InfluxDB via the HTTP API and a token. The token can be generated via the InfluxDB webUI under the ‘Tokens’ tab in the ‘Data’ section.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
curl --request POST localhost:8086/api/v2/write?org=ORG&bucket=BUCKET&precision=s \
     --header "Authorization: Token TOKEN" \
     --header "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8" \
     --header "Accept: application/json" \
     --data-binary "sensor1,location=living temperature=25,humidity=65"
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Telegraf</h2>

<p>I already had a <a href="https://www.co2meter.com/collections/desktop/products/co2mini-co2-indoor-air-quality-monitor">CO2Mini</a> meter from way back which I can read out via <a href="https://github.com/dmage/co2mon">co2mon</a>.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ co2mond -D /tmp/co2mon
CntR	437
Tamb	21.1625
CntR	437
Tamb	21.1625
…
{% endhighlight %}

<p>co2mon updates the CntR and Tamb files in the specified directory with the latest readings. Using the ‘exec’ Telegraf <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.20/plugins/">plugin</a> we can read these values and hand them off to InfluxDB. Telegraf can read its configuration from the InfluxDB instance so all Telegraf’s agents are centrally configured, cool!</p>

<p>Create a new Telegraf configuration via the ‘Telegraf’ tab in the ‘Data’ section of the InfluxDB webUI.</p>

{% highlight toml %}
[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]	
  urls = ["http://localhost:8086"]
  token = "$INFLUX_TOKEN"
  organization = "myorg"
  bucket = "home"
[[inputs.exec]]
  commands = ["cat /tmp/co2mon/CntR"]
  name_override = "co2_concentration"
  data_format = "value"
  data_type = "integer"
[[inputs.exec]]
  commands = ["cat /tmp/co2mon/Tamb"]
  name_override = "temp"
  data_format = "value"
  data_type = "float"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>On the client (the machine the CO<sub>2</sub> monitor is connected to) I start the Telegraf agent with this remote configuration.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
export INFLUX_TOKEN=TOKEN
telegraf --config http://localhost:8086/api/v2/telgrafs/097240ebe8df7215
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The InfluxDB installation and configuration process was amazingly easy! Collecting data via the API works as expected, I can easily see how to hook this up with an existing web application. The Telegraf agent is powerful and once I understood what plugin to use, I was impressed by how easy it is to link a data source to InfluxDB. The InfluxDB webUI and color scheme are simply gorgeous, both light and dark modes.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to add markers to the graphs. A horizontal line for a maximum value (dangerous levels of CO<sub>2</sub> for example) or a horizontal one to mark events (e.g., opened a window at 12:32). Maybe combined with the alerting system that’s already included? It feels weird that critical alerts don’t show up on the dashboards.</p>

<p>The alerting system itself is too basic as well. Slack, Pagerduty and HTTP endpoints come out-of-the-box, but I expected more powerful features here.</p>

<p>Setting up new and beautiful graphs, gauges, heatmaps, etc. is easy via the webUI. I did run in some smaller bugs though (the gauge’s “optional suffix” setting for example freezes the dashboard) or adding a second moving average query to my graph would show weird extra lines. Nothing that can’t be fixed in a patch release.</p>

<p>I would like visualizations for a fixed timeframe. A heatmap of all days combined to name one. Showing CO<sub>2</sub> levels are consistently higher than average around 11AM for example. I didn’t find a way to create such visualizations, only the “past x seconds/minutes/hours” ones. I am not sure if that’s currently possible.</p>

<p>To end: InfluxDB’s data collection and visualizations are top notch, all without having to write a single line of code! The alerting/insight part could be improved upon.</p>
