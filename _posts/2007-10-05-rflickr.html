<div class="narrow-col">
  <p>As I had some troubles finding out how to show some of my own Flickr photos on this site using the Flickr <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> and Ruby on Rails I thought it would be useful to write it down in a small tutorial.</p>
  <h2>STEP 1: Finding a library: rFlickr</h2>

  <p>Flickr lists 3 possible Ruby frameworks for their API. After trying flickr.rb (no longer available) and not being able to login I decided to switch to <a href="https://github.com/digitalpardoe/rflickr/" title="The Flickr API kit I choose">rFlickr</a> as it seems the most popular one.</p>

  <p>Start with installing the rFlickr library. You may need to uninstall a previous library if you installed another one earlier.</p>

  {% highlight bash %}
  gem install rflickr
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h2>STEP 2: Get a Flickr API key</h2>

  <p>Flickr doesn’t use the username/password combination as most other API's do. An application can ask for permissions which the user has to grant. A token is returned when this is done allowing the application to connect the next time so we'll only have to do this once. <a href="http://flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/" title="Request an API key">Apply for a key</a> at the Flickr website and remember the key and the shared secret. I use a “Web Application” key as I want to use it for my blog.</p>

  <h2>STEP 3: Get a Flickr token</h2>

  <p>Start your development environment:</p>

  {% highlight bash %}
  ./script/console
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Next load the newly installed rFlickr module and ask for a Flickr frob using the API key and shared secret you got earlier.</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  >> require 'flickr'
  => []
  >> flickr = Flickr.new('/tmp/flickr.cache', YOUR_KEY, YOUR_SECRET)
  => #<Flickr:0x...
  >> flickr.auth.login_link
  => 'http://flickr.com/services/auth/?api_sig=a07a7...'
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>This will return a URL you need to copy &amp; paste in your browser to allow the application to read, write and delete your photos. If you don’t need all this permissions your can add the “perms” parameter for a less greedy permissions. Use the following if you only need read access to the photos:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  >> flickr.auth.login_link(perms='read')
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Allow the application to access your photos when you open the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>. You can request the forb we need and make sure to to keep it for now.</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  >> flickr.auth.getFrob
  => '7215760...'
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Now we’ll need a token. The token is more permanent as the frob but we need the forb to get one. Finally cache the token:</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  >> flickr.auth.getToken('YOUR_FROB')
  => #<Flickr::Token:0x...
  >> flickr.auth.cache_token
  => 154
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h2>STEP 4: Give me my photos!</h2>

  <p>Now it’s time to do something more useful with the token. What about showing the thumbnails of the 6 last added photos? We’ll need your NSID which is the strange number in your Flickr URL that looks like 26227936@N00.</p>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  def flickr
    require 'flickr'
    photos = Array.new
    flickr = Flickr.new('/tmp/flickr.cache', 'YOUR_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET')
    photo_list = flickr.people.getPublicPhotos('YOUR_NSID','',6)
    photo_list.each do |photo|
      photos.push( {'id' => photo.id, 'source' => photo.sizes[:Square].source} )
    end
    return photos
  end
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>Look, you now have an array with the last 6 posted public photos and their ID.</p>
</div>
