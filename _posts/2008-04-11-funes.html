<p><a class="h-card" href="http://www.fousa.be/" rel="friend met colleague co-resident">Jelle</a> did it again! He wrote Funes as an Objective-C learning app: a one-purpose application to rate your iTunes songs form the menu bar. It’s Mac OS X Leopard only at the moment but he is working on a Tiger compatible version as well.</p>

<p>I was quite skeptical when he submitted his application on the Apple website, the surely must be a few 100 applications like this out there… no? Well, it seems there isn’t and Funes was an Apple staff pick right away. The next day <a href="https://lifehacker.com/378617/rate-songs-from-the-status-menu-with-funes/" title="Rate Songs from the Status Menu with Funes">Lifehacker</a> and <a href="https://www.simplehelp.net/2008/04/10/how-to-quickly-rate-songs-in-itunes-os-x/" title="How to quickly rate songs in iTunes">Simple Help</a> featured his application, impressive.</p>

<p>Lifhacker reader dpseal notes that you can rate songs with a right click on the iTunes icon in the dock as well. This tip is even easier as the little Funes application. Other ways are ratings with <a href="https://qsapp.com/" title="A Mac OS X application launcher">Quicksilver</a> or <a href="http://growl.info/documentation/growltunes.php">GrowlTunes</a>.</p>
