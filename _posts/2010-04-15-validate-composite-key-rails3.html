description: Comparing model validations between Ruby on Rails 2 and 3 with composite database keys.

<p>Consider a ‘families' table in a database with a ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ column. You add a composite key so that the combination husband and wife is unique. You don’t want a second record with the same husband and wife combination. At the database level your migration could look like:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
add_index :families, [:husband, :wife], :unique => true
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Validations in Rails 2</h2>

<p>Now you want to add a corresponding validation in the ‘family’ model. In Ruby on Rails 2 we can use a scope:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
validates_uniqueness_of :husband, :scope => :wife
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Validations in Rails 3</h2>

<p>In Rails 3 this looks slightly different:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
validates :husband, :presence => true, :uniqueness => {:scope => :wife}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I wouldn’t have found this without the help of KandadaBoggu and epochwolf on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2533502/rails-3-validate-combined-values" alt="Rails 3: Validate combined values question">stackoverflow</a>.</p>
