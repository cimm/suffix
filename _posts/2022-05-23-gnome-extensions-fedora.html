description: Installing GNOME extensions via Fedora’s ‘dnf’ instead of Firefox.
---

<p>I always installed GNOME extensions via Firefox. You first install the GNOME shell integration <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/" title="GNOME Shell Integration addon @ Firefox">Firefox addon</a> after which extensions can be installed from the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org">GNOME Extensions</a> website. This always felt like an atypical way to install Linux software. <abbr title="Today I Learned">TIL</abbr> GNOME extensions can also be installed via the system’s package manager!</p>

<h2>Fedora</h2>

<p>GNOME extensions can be installed via the package manager and are activated via the accompanying ‘gnome-extensions-app’.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
dnf install gnome-extensions-app
dnf install gnome-shell-extension-appindicator
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Open the GNOME “Extensions” application to enable or disable installed extensions.</p>

<p>If I had read the notification at the top of the GNOME extensions website more carefully, I would have known this years ago. Oops.</p>
