description: Programming CODAv, my first native desktop Linux application.
---

<div class="narrow-col">

  <p>Being a recent <a href="/blog/year-of-linux-desktop/" title="The year of my Linux desktop">Linux switcher</a> I wanted to have a look at Linux desktop application development. It has been ages since I worked on a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> application and since I wrote Windows and macOS applications in the past it was time to try the Linux side.</p>

  <h2>The App</h2>

  <p>When my colleagues kept asking to verify the transactions included in the <abbr title="Coded Statement of Account">CODA</abbr> files they are sending to the bank I knew what to build: a CODA viewer! It only needs to parse an <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> file and show the transactions in a tabular format. A CODA or “XML message for Credit Transfer Initiation” (<abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 20022 XML) file encodes European credit transfers (<abbr title="Single Euro Payments Area">SEPA</abbr>) in a standard way. It defines the movement of funds from the debtor account to a creditor.</p>

  <p>A little web app would probably have been more useful (cross-platform, no installation) and easier to build given my background as a web developer, but where is the fun in that?</p>

  <p>The application would be known as <a href="https://github.com/cimm/codav" title="CODAv source code @ Github" rel="me">CODAv</a>, for CODA viewer. It can be <a href="https://snapcraft.io/codav">downloaded</a> from the snap store or you can build it from <a href="https://github.com/cimm/codav" title="CODAv source code @ Github" rel="me">source</a>.</p>

  <h2>The Toolset</h2>

  <p>In my Windows days, I used Visual Basic with Visual Studio, on macOS it was Xcode with Objective-C, on Linux it is&hellip;? Linux being Linux there isn't a go-to "this is how you build a Linux application" solution, there are many.</p>

  <p>The most common choices seem to be a C or C++ application with GTK+ or Qt for the graphical part. Then there are the higher level languages like Python or Go using GTK+ or Qt bindings and finally, you have Electron.</p>
  
  <p>Electron is the new kid on the block and great for cross-platform applications but it feels too similar to web development and I wanted to get out of my comfort zone. Ruby with GTK+ or Qt would have been the most logical choice but most Linuxy people seem to prefer Python over Ruby so that didn't feel like the &ldquo;right&rdquo; combination. Back to C or C++ then?</p>
  
  <p>It's remarkably hard to find good getting started with Linux development tutorials, except for elementary OS' splendid &ldquo;<a href="https://elementary.io/docs/code/getting-started#getting-started" title="Developers > Getting Started @ elementary OS">Getting Started</a>&rdquo; tutorial, a refreshing find! They use Vala, which generates C code, and is tightly coupled with GTK+. That concluded my quest: <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala" title="Vala @ GNOME Wiki">Vala</a> with GTK+ it is.</p>

  <h2>The Lessons</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Vala is a nice language but I can't get rid of the CoffeeScript feeling: don't learn CoffeeScript if you hate to learn JavaScript, use CoffeeScript after you learned how JavaScript works. The same feels true here: I used Vala so I didn't have to think about C. You quickly get stuck when the C parts shine through. Vala is also a niche language, mainly used for elementary OS and some GNOME apps, so it's hard to find documentation (outside of the <a href="https://valadoc.org" title="Vala API documentation">Valadoc</a> site). I did manage to compile the application on macOS though, without a single code change. I did not expect that.</li>
    <li>The build tools are weird coming from web development. I used autotools and cmake, both powerful tools, and it felt good to finally understand the &ldquo;configure, make, make install&rdquo; magic, but they aren't fun to use. It's probably a lack of experience, but I am constantly fighting to understand Makefiles.</li>
    <li>I never built a deb or rpm package and went directly to <a href="https://snapcraft.io/" title="Containerised software packages that are simple to install on all major Linux systems">snaps</a> to package the application. Time well spent. Snap packages are probably the most exciting development in the Linux desktop space at the moment (as are <a href="https://www.flatpak.org/" title="Official Flatpack website">Flatpacks</a>, but I didn't have a look at those yet).</li>
  </ul>
