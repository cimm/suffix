<p>I want to build a power plug that only works when the solar panels on the roof are generating electricity, useful for charging a phone or my e-bike. I can leave the bike plugged in and it would only charge when there is a surplus of electricity. When it’s cloudy the power should shut off until the <abbr title="photovoltaic">PV</abbr> installation is back, producing clean electricity again. The first step for this long-term goal is to know if the PV panels are generating electricity. My 10+-year-old solar installation and the inverter, a Diehl AKO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823120933/http://www.diehl.com:80/en/diehl-controls/photovoltaics/inverter/s-inverter.html" title="Old PLATINUM S inverter product page via the Internet Archive">PLATINUM 2100 S</a>, did not come with nice graphs to monitor the solar output. The inverter does have an EIA485 network port that can be used to attach a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120708234955/http://www.diehl.com:80/en/diehl-controls/photovoltaics/monitoring/pv-monitor.html" title="Old PLATINUM PV-Monitor product page via the Internet Archive">monitor device</a>, but it’s so old even though the website is no longer available.</p>

<p>Luckily, I do have a single-phase digital <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210928095605if_/https://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/181764598310-0-1/s-l1000.jpg" title="Photo of a kW meter"><abbr title="kilowatt">kW</abbr> meter</a> in the fuse box, as is often the case in Belgium for our “<a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/groenestroomcertificaten-voor-zonnepanelen" title=" Groenestroomcertificaten voor zonnepanelen" hreflang="nl" lang="nl">groenestroomcertificaten</a>” (link in Dutch). The kilowatt meter flashes every time a watt-hour of power passes the meter. This sums up to 1.000 pulses per <abbr title="kilowatt-hour">kWh</abbr>. The meter also has two S0 pins which act as a switch every time the <abbr title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> flashes. The Arduino can detect these voltage changes and count the pulses, and thus learn the generated power from the solar installation. I used an old Arduino Ethernet, a <a href="http://resisto.rs/#10k" title="Color codes for a 10kΩ resistor">10kΩ</a> resistor, some wires—all found in my “big ol’ pile of electronics”—and loaded the <a href="https://github.com/cimm/pvpulse" title="Sketch to load on the Arduino Ethernet @ Github">sketch</a> on the Arduino. The sketch waits for an interrupt (= Voltage change) on pin 2 and fires an <abbr title="Message Queue Telemetry Transport">MQTT</abbr> message to the broker when it when it does.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> The Arduino and S0 pins are low voltage but a fuse box also has high voltage wires. These can cause injury or even death. <strong>Be careful when handling high voltages!</strong></p>

<p>I can now subscribe, using <a href="https://mqtt-explorer.com/" title="MQTT Explorer product page">MQTT Explorer</a> for example, to the MQTT topic configured in the sketch and count the pulses. A recently received MQTT message means the solar panels are working hard and doing their job.</p>

<h2>What is next?</h2>

<p>The Arduino Ethernet needs a power and ethernet cable and my proof-of-concept is a bit messy. I am thinking of porting the sketch to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266" title="ESP8266 @ Wikipedia">ESP8266</a> using <abbr title="Wireless Fidelity">Wi-Fi</abbr> and a battery to see if I can clean up the wiring a bit. I also need a local MQTT broker and some database to store the logs. Maybe a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafana" title="Grafana @ Wikipedia">Grafana</a> dashboard would be nice as well?</p>
