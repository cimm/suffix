description: Secure Synology NAS SSH connections for automated tasks with key pairs.
---

<p>My goal is to set up automated <a href="https://restic.net/" title="A modern backup program that can back up your files">restic</a> backups to a <a href="https://www.synology.com/products" title="Synology product page">Synology</a> <abbr title="Network Attached Storage">NAS</abbr> from my laptop. Manually entering a password for each backup defeats the purpose of the automation. Just as we use public/private key pairs in UN*X to bypass password prompts, we can apply the same idea for automated access our Synology. It’s built on Linux after all.</p>

<p>This guide is based on a Synology system running <abbr title="Disk Station Manager">DSM</abbr> 7.1.1. Keep in mind that future DSM versions might introduce changes, so some steps could vary.</p>

<p>We’ll assume we have already generated a public and private key pair. If not, there are numerous resources available online, such as <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen" title="How to Use ssh-keygen to Generate a New SSH Key? @ ssh.com">this one</a>.</p>

<h2>Enable <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr></h2>

<p>First, we need to enable SSH on the Synology NAS. Navigate to “Control Panel → Terminal & SNMP” and check the "Enable SSH service” option. At this point, we can connect from our laptop using <kbd>ssh user@synology</kbd> (replace the username and Synology address), but we’ll still be prompted for a password.</p>

<h2>User Home Folders</h2>

<p>To enable automated authentication, we need to upload a public key to the Synology. This requires enabling user home folders. Go to “Control Panel → User & Groups”, select the “Advanced” tab, and in the “User Home” section, check “Enable user home service”. We should now see a new ‘home’ directory in the Synology File Station.</p>

<h2>Adding a Public Key</h2>

<p>Now, let’s add a public key to our user’s home folder on the NAS. Using File Station, locate the <kbd>/home</kbd> directory for the user used for the automation. Inside this directory, create a new subdirectory named <kbd>.ssh</kbd>. Within this directory, create a file named <kbd>authorized_keys</kbd> (with no extension). Finally, paste the entire contents of the public key into this ‘authorized_keys’ file. The public key of course, the private one should never leave the laptop.</p>

<p>For SSH to function correctly, we need to change the permissions for the <kbd>.ssh</kbd> folder and its contents. Start by logging in via SSH with the password. Once connected, change the permissions of the <kbd>.ssh</kbd> folder to ‘drwxr-xr-x’. Similarly, for the <kbd>authorized_keys</kbd> file within that folder, set its permissions to ‘-rw-r--r--’.

{% highlight bash %}
$ chmod 0755 .ssh/
$ chmod 0644 .ssh/authorized_keys
{% endhighlight %}

<p>With these steps completed, we now have password-less SSH access to the Synology NAS via <kbd>ssh user@synology</kbd>. We won’t be promted for a password any longer.</p>
