  <p>Bunker was asked to photograph Mobile Mondays in Amsterdam. He was kind enough to put me on the guest list and even offered a taxi to Amsterdam and back. Would be stupid not to go, wouldn't it?</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="vcard"><span class="fn n"><span class="given-name">Raimo</span> <span class="family-name">van der Klein</span></span>, <span class="title">founder</span> of <span class="org">Mobile Monday Amsterdam</span></span>, opened with a presentation about the &lsquo;smart context&rsquo; or how context could change depending on your state: happy, sad, at the airport, in the office, etc. E.g. the software could learn what is normal for you (commute) and share abnormal (leaving for holidays) events with friends.</li>
    <li><span class="vcard"><span class="fn">Johan Koolwaaij</span>, <span class="title">scientific researcher</span> at <span class="org">Telematica Institute</span></span>, showed <a href="http://www.iyouit.eu">IYOUIT</a>. A mobile app that gathers data around you and about you. Sounded like a huge &lsquo;log everything about your life&rsquo; but not exactly production ready yet.</li>
    <li><span class="vcard"><span class="fn">Raymond Perrenet</span>, <span class="title">EVP Strategy &amp; Development</span> at <span class="org">T-Mobile</span></span>, about the raise of data plans on mobile phones with the introduction of the iPhone (and with Android around the corner). Are mobile data plans finally taking off?</li>

  <h2>Teemu Arina</h2>

  <p><span class="vcard"><a class="url fn" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905033343/http://tarina.blogging.fi:80/" title="Tarina: Teemu Ariana's website">Teemu Arina</a></span> took another approach. He went for 3 pecha kucha presentations in a row: &ldquo;Changeable in appearance, mood, or purpose&rdquo;, &ldquo;Undergoing a shift in status&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moving or changing quickly from one state or condition to another&rdquo;. All three visually stunning presentations in his own eccentric style. Loved it! This guy knows how to entertain his public. I'll copy Dorien here and link to Teemu's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160113023509/http://tarina.blogging.fi/2008/10/18/speaking-at-mobile-monday-amsterdam/">own post</a> about his presentation.</p>

  <h2>Bruce Sterling</h2>

  <p>Closing speaker was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling" title="Bruce Sterling article @ Wikipedia"><span class="vcard"><span class="fn">Bruce Sterling</span></span></a>, an American science fiction author, I had never heard of. His talk sounded very religious <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/schoeters/3000514199/in/set-72157608628987398/" rel="me" title="Sterling speeching from the pulpit in De Rode Hoed @ Flickr">standing on the pulpit</a> and speaking about the &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;. He explained that people close to the volcano will experience the greatest impact: your grandmother's life probably won't be affected with the introduction of the iPhone when she still uses a landline but yours will. In 10 years time you can still use a hammer but your iPhone will be useless. A nice point - made me think - after seeing the BlackBerry Storm vs. the G1 fight on stage earlier. In Sterling's words:</p>

  <blockquote>&ldquo;I want you to think real hard about the values you are going to save and stop worrying about the plastic.&rdquo;</blockquote>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>Overall it was an interesting day on a beautiful location, almost feeling surreal driving back to Belgium in the thick fog. The best part, however, were the discussions with <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn n" rel="acquaintance met" href="http://theicecreamdebate.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/mobile-monday-amsterdam-think-about-value" title="Mobile Monday Amsterdam: &ldquo;Think about value&rdquo; @ Theicecreamdebate"><span class="given-name">Dorien</span></a>, <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn n" rel="acquaintance met" href="http://delvauxkoen.blogspot.com/"><span class="given-name">Koen</span></a> and <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn nickname" rel="friend met" href="https://www.thebeard.be/">Bunker</a></span>!
