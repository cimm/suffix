<p><a href="http://www.technorati.com/" class="ext">Technorati</a>, a search engine for searching blogs, allows any blog owner to &lsquo;ping&rsquo; his/her blog. In this way Technorati can index your blog based on the tags you assigned to your post.</p>

<p>You can do this manually by requesting a ping with the &lsquo;<a href="http://technorati.com/ping/" title="Ping form to check when you pinged Technorati" class="ext">Technorati ping form</a>&rsquo; but let's have a look how we can automate this, shall we? Turns out it's really easy to do so even though it's hard to find some documentation about this on Google.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First we'll need Ruby on Rails built in XMLRPC protocol and create a new client that listens to the Technorati web service.</li>
  <li>Next we call the weblogUpdates.ping service method and pass the name and URL of our blog. We'll keep returned result in the result parameter.</li>
  <li>Now we only need to check if the request succeeded by looking at the result parameter and we are done.</li>
</ol>

<samp>
require 'xmlrpc/client'<br />
server = XMLRPC::Client.new("rpc.technorati.com", "/rpc/ping")<br />
result = server.call("weblogUpdates.ping", "YOUR BLOG NAME", "YOUR BLOG URL")<br />
if result['flerror']<br />
   flash[:error] = result['message']<br />
end
</samp>
