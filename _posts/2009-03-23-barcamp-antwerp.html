<p>This weekend was BarCamp time again, the very first <a href="http://www.barcampantwerpen.org/" class="ext">BarCamp Antwerp</a> to be specific. There was some heated discussion on the intertubes about the true meaning of BarCamps and I was afraid this would have a negative impact on the quality but au contraire, I had a great time!</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="vcard"><span class="fn">B&eacute;ate Vervaecke</span></span> kicked off with her &ldquo;De 3 Hoofddeugden Van Een Ad Words Beheerder&rdquo; (in Dutch) on how you can optimize your AdWords campaigns. Even though I don't use AdWords it's a presentation to remember for later, loads of useful tips.</li>

  <li>The next one was <span class="vcard"><span class="fn n"><span class="given-name">Thomas</span> <span class="family-name">Vande Casteele</span>
  </span> with his advanced Google Analytics course: &ldquo;How to Pimp Google Analytics, Apply Ninja analysis and find the Golden Nuggets in your traffic&rdquo;. It's obvious now that I have been abusing Google Analytics in the past. It's a really powerful tool but you need to learn how to use it.</li>

  <li>Following was <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">Tijs Vrolix</span></span> with "How to create a 30 minutes presentation in 10 minutes" which had nothing to do with presentations but an "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=57382448962" title="Join the Facebook group" class="ext">I Heart Phone</a>" call for members. He is looking for

  <blockquote cite="http://tijsvrolix.be/2009/03/22/i-heart-phone-barcamp-presentation">Belgian designers, developers and thinkers working on iPhone (and mobile in general) apps and interested in meeting up to share experiences and thoughts [...].</blockquote>

  A great idea, I'm looking forward to the first meeting. We also had a short discussion on copyright law and how to persuade public companies to open up their data.</li>

  <li><span class="vcard"><span class="fn n"><span class="given-name">Stef</span></span></span> explained some basic electronics for his  <a href="http://blog.stef.be/barcamp_arduino" class="ext">Tweetshirt 2.0</a> concept. I had read about the Ardiuno but Stef convinced me, I need this! He gave an awesome presentation and opened a whole new geeky world to me.</li>

  <li>It looked like <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">Koen Delvaux</span></span> continued Stef's presentation with &ldquo;The Kodel, an RC airplane autopilot for aerial photography&rdquo;. He built a system where his remote controlled plane will follow waypoints (added via Google Earth) to a certain location where the plane will circle around and take pictures of the area (read: low budget aerial photography)... pure genius. I have been waiting for this presentation and it sure didn't disappoint.</li>

  <li>Some more coffee and off we went to <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">Stijn Wijndaele</span></span>'s Twitpickr presentation. He got a lot of Twitter buzz last week so I wanted to hear his story. I don't always agree with his statements but auch, this guy has a special presentation style.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before I forget: a special thanks to <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.tenderfeelings.be/" class="fn url ext">Anne Verberckmoes</a></span> for initiating this day! You can find most of the presentations above (and more) on the BarCamp Antwerp <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tag/barcampantwerp" title="SlideShare presentations tagged with barcampantwerp" class="ext">SlideShare page</a>.</p>
