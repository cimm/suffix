  <p>This weekend was BarCamp time again, the very first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090625132350/http://www.barcampantwerpen.org/" title="BarCamp Antwerp @ Internet Archive">BarCamp Antwerp</a> to be specific. There was some heated discussion on the intertubes about the true meaning of BarCamps and I was afraid this would have a negative impact on the quality but au contraire, I had a great time!</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="h-card">Béate Vervaecke</span> kicked off with her “De 3 Hoofddeugden Van Een Ad Words Beheerder” (in Dutch) on how you can optimize your AdWords campaigns, a presentation to remember for later, loads of useful tips.</li>

    <li>The next one was <span class="h-card">Thomas Vande Casteele</span> with his advanced Google Analytics course: “How to Pimp Google Analytics, Apply Ninja analysis and find the Golden Nuggets in your traffic”. It’s obvious now that I have been abusing Google Analytics in the past. It’s a really powerful tool but you need to learn how to use it.</li>

    <li>Following was <span class="h-card">Tijs Vrolix</span> with “How to create a 30 minutes presentation in 10 minutes” which had nothing to do with presentations but with the “I Heart Phone” Facebook group. He is looking for

    <blockquote cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20090425224618/https://tijsvrolix.be/2009/03/22/i-heart-phone-barcamp-presentation">Belgian designers, developers and thinkers working on iPhone (and mobile in general) apps and interested in meeting up to share experiences and thoughts [...].</blockquote>

    Nice idea, I’m looking forward to the first meeting. We also had a short discussion on copyright law and how to persuade public companies to open up their data.</li>

    <li><span class="h-card">Stef</span> explained some basic electronics for his <a href="http://blog.stef.be/barcamp_arduino" rel="met">Tweetshirt 2.0</a> concept. I had read about the Ardiuno but Stef convinced me, I need this! He gave an awesome presentation and opened a whole new geeky world to me.</li>

    <li>It looked like <span class="h-card">Koen Delvaux</span> continued Stef’s presentation with “The Kodel, an RC airplane autopilot for aerial photography”. He built a system where his remote controlled plane will follow waypoints (added via Google Earth) to a certain location where the plane will circle around and take pictures of the area (read: low budget aerial photography), pure genius. I have been waiting for this presentation and it sure didn’t disappoint.</li>

    <li>Some more coffee and off we went to <span class="h-card">Stijn Wijndaele</span>’s Twitpickr presentation. He got a lot of Twitter buzz last week so I wanted to hear his story. I don’t always agree with his statements but auch, this guy has a special presentation style.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Before I forget: a special thanks to <span class="h-card">Anne Verberckmoes</span> for initiating this day. You can find most of the presentations above (and more) on the BarCamp Antwerp <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/tag/barcampantwerp" title="SlideShare presentations tagged with barcampantwerp">SlideShare page</a>.</p>
